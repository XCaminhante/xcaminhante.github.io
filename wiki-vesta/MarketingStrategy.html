<h3 id="Winning_Concepts">Winning Concepts</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><p class="line874">&quot;things that should make you want to use Vesta as soon as you appreciate them&quot; <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">CVS will corrupt your data sooner or later (incidentally, I heard last week that one of the commercial ones - <a class="nonexistent" href="AlienBrain.html">AlienBrain</a> - also does this, and rumours that Microsoft's Visual <a class="nonexistent" href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> *still* also does this!) <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span></li><li>Source code is not sufficient to compile a program (and this is the main reason people prefer binaries, and that oss projects without binaries lose many potential users). Compiling a program requires the correct versions of all libraries and the correct build files with the correct compiler options. If this sounds complex and hard, it's because it is: and it explains most if not all the problems people have with e.g. getting linux kernels to compiled. Distributing make files with a project goes part way to achieving this, but you MUST instead distribute all the libraries you were using as well - re-compiled as necessary for each kernel + arch combination. Almost no-one actually does this because it's too much effort; their assumptions in not doing so cause the problems seen by users. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span></li><li>On average a medium sized project with a 10-person dev team wastes many hours per person per week just waiting for slow re-compiles. Whenever you hit problems where you have to do a full &quot;clean&quot; re-build of the entire system to cure compilation problems you can instantly add another hour or more to your compile time that day. As explained by the well-known Joel on Software, the constant interruptions of waiting for long compiles waste additional time just because they slow down your progress and break your concentration. <span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span></li><li>...others? <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Vesta, meanwhile (one for each item above): <span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><ul><li>...uses correct locking to prevent checkin race conditions that could corrupt data <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span></li><li>...versions all the build info as well as the source - and seamlessly does so pulling-in the full source + build info for every 3rd party library (assuming it exists on the internet in a vesta repository), so that you never have to distribute the libs, every user has direct access automatically to the correct version for them for their platform - and the vesta build language makes it impossible to ever break this, by refusing to allow &quot;dangling&quot; dependency references <span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span></li><li>...performs distributed builds across all your machines on the LAN &quot;out of the box&quot; with only a few seconds setup required per machine. It also caches every sub-part of every build step with 100% accuracy, providing very fine-grained caching. Finally, the distributed builds are automatically parallelized whilst preserving all appropriate dependencies. <span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">-- note: the second problem above is so extreme that these days I *never* compile any programs from source, no matter what; if I absolutely must get it compiled, I'll get someone else to do it for me - my time is too valuable to waste on this. Except ... with vesta, I have no qualms about replicating and compiling anything, because I *know* it will Just Work (on average, around 80% of linux source I downloaded the make files for didn't work first time, and around 30% still didn't work even after moderate debugging of poor makefiles, missing dependencies, incorrect library versions, etc) <span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><p class="line874">Summary: &quot;it's a whole new world of development – but no more complex than the tools you already use – and whatever tool you use, this one fixes some of the biggest problems you already have&quot; <span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><p class="line874">Problems with current approach: <span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><ul><li>lists 10 great features; People care more about *benefits*: how do these features &quot;make my life better&quot; <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span></li><li>tells people what's good about vesta: people who aren't actively trying to change DON'T CARE; instead you need to tell people what's wrong with what they've got, tell them the problems they already know they have, so that they come back asking &quot;Yeah, I know, it sucks. But it's not like YOU've got an alternative, have you?&quot; (at which point they're ready to hear that actually, yes you do ... ). Also...people who are less skilled with SCM selection (most of them!) also appreciate being warned and educated about the problems with their current SCM of choice; frequently, being told about the gotchas that will hurt them in the future if they carry on with X (carry on building up their expertise with it; carry on putting more of their systems into it) will make them try to escape X and start actively looking for a Y to switch to. <span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Broad strategy: <span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><ul><li>Make is the biggest single target to unseat: 50% of all Make users is a bigger market than any other. <span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span></li><li>CVS is the easiest large target to unseat: smaller than Make, yet biggest in it's space and so very bad <span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span></li><li>Target those currently evaluating/moving to SVN/Bitkeeper/etc: most of the users most easy to convince are probably not using CVS any more <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span></li><li>Create the idea in consumer's heads that all SCMs and BSs must be &quot;perfect&quot; (stable, robust, thread-safe, repeatable, etc): this immediately causes them to avoid many alternatives (CVS, Git, Make, Ant, ???) <span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span></li><li>Show users with simple examples some &quot;magic&quot; from combined SCM+BS (that can't be done with non-integrated e.g. using Make + CVS): the USP where Vesta has no competitors! <span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span></li><li>Setup easy, simple, inviting welcomes: when a user is flirting with vesta, re-assure them that this is a clever choice, that they aren't buying-in to Betamax, give them an easy migration-path specific to their background, convince them they have little new to learn <span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

People are overwhelmed by the importance of choosing an SCM and by the bewildering array of choices, and want the minimum effort way of feeling they made a wise decision. &quot;No windows support&quot; hands this to them on a plate. <span class="anchor" id="line-114"></span></li><li>the inability of a newbie to setup a laptop slave repository in 10 minutes to demo vesta is another easy target <span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span></li><li>...indeed, anything the clueless user might think of to try-out vesta without actually doing a complete formal evaluation, and which turns out to be prohibitively hard or to require them to learn vesta first, is a major &quot;breaking point&quot; in their purchasing/adoption decision-process. <span class="anchor" id="line-116"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">question/observation: if we expect people to be up-and-running in 10 min trying things, does it follow that we will have to enable them to do so <em>without</em> learning SDL?
