<h1> Perl Window Manager </h1>
<p>
  <b>perlwm</b> is a window manager written entirely in perl. Why would you want such a thing? Why would a perl one be
  worth having? Who knows - it seemed like a good idea at the time; I was getting fed up with having to switch between
  workspaces to get stuff done on my laptop and I had some vague ideas about how a better window manager might help me.
  I set off to find the perfect window manager, but couldn't really find one which solved all my problems.
</p><p>
  So, rather than do <em>the right thing</em> and contribute to an existing window manager, I decided to write my own -
  in perl. All the mature window managers looked pretty tricky to make any major changes - especially changes in
  behaviour. Also, I thought that perl would be good at some of the configuration stuff I wanted, and I was hacking a
  lot of perl recently and doing wonderful things in just a few lines.
</p><p>
  There had been talk of perl window managers before, but I couldn't find one which had got as far as actually managing
  any windows. Not really knowing where to start, I stumbled across X11::Protocol on CPAN. That and the chapter on
  window management in one of the X books got me going. Within a couple of hours, I was drawing my own frames.
</p><p>
  Since other people had mentioned the idea before, I thought that making it all public would in some way repay my debt
  to society and so this project (kindly hosted for free by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>) was
  started.
