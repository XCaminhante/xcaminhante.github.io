<body BGCOLOR="#efefff">
In mid June 2000, I found myself driving through central Illinois
at 3 AM, primarily because my flight the previous night had been delayed
more than six hours.&nbsp; Somehow the combination of sleep deprivation
and <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/00/06/13/2326222.shtml">a story
I had read the same week on a programming contest to develop a haiku generator</a>
resulted in the following three Vesta haiku.
<blockquote>A source or derived?
<br>The model can't distinguish
<br>It's just a text string
<p><i>[Lamenting the lack of a debugger for Vesta builds:]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Alas the build fails!
<br>If you need partial results,
<br>You must hack bridges
<p><i>[The following actually happened at SRC in September 2000.]</i>
<p>Cautionary note:
<br>Ship Vesta release as links,
<br>Weeder eats itself</blockquote>
