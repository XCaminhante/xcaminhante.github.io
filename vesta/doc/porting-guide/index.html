<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
   Vesta is a software build system that is built using itself. &nbsp;This
 document describes a boot-strapping approach to porting Vesta, which is
the  way all ports have been done so far. &nbsp;In brief, the steps involved
are:<br>
     
<ol>
     <li>Use Vesta on a currently working platform to "host" the port. &nbsp;Set
 up to run tools on the porting target through remote execution (using <tt>rsh</tt>
or <tt>ssh</tt>).</li>
     <li>Construct a build environment (<tt>std_env</tt>) for the porting 
target system type.</li>
     <li>Work through building and testing the Vesta constiuent libraries 
and  component tools for the new platform (as with porting any other software
 system).<br>
     </li>
     
</ol>
     
<a name="Target Platform Requirements"><h3>Target Platform
Requirements</h3></a>

  Vesta should be readily portable to any UNIX-like platform. &nbsp;Specifically, 
the features most neccessary for a Vesta port are:<br>
   
<ul>
    <li>An NFS client. &nbsp;The Vesta repository's filesystem is presented
 through an NFS v2 interface. &nbsp;Both building and editing in checkout
sessions use this interface.</li>
    <li>The <tt>chroot</tt> system call. &nbsp;Vesta's builder uses the <tt>chroot</tt>
 system call to encapsulate the filesystem used by each build step.</li>
   <li>C and C++ compilers. &nbsp;Vesta is written primarily in C++, with 
a few components written in C.</li>

    <li>A garbage collector for C/C++. &nbsp;Vesta ports working as of
    this writing use
    <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">the Boehm
    collector</a> (which already supports many platforms), but it may
    be possible to use other garbage collectors.</li>

    <li>Support for POSIX threads (<tt>pthreads</tt>). &nbsp;Both the Vesta
 servers and clients use multi-threading. &nbsp;In most cases an abstraction
 layer (part of the <tt>basics</tt> library) is used, so other multi-threading
 APIs may also be usable with additional effort.<br>
    </li>
   
</ul>

<p>
  Ports to non-UNIX platforms may be possible, but would require much
  more work. &nbsp;For example, one could get by without the
  <tt>chroot</tt> system call if there were a way to intercept all
  filesystem I/O operations (perhaps through clever uses of dynamic
  linking) and redirect them to an encapsulated
  filesystem. &nbsp;Another possibility would be using a virtual
  machine to provide encapsulation. &nbsp;Similarly, one could imagine
  adding support for a different network filesystem protocol to the
  repository.
</p>
   
<a name="Alternative Approaches"><h3>Alternative Approaches</h3></a>
  The boot-strapping approach described below is, of course, not the only 
way to port Vesta to a new platform. &nbsp;However, it is the method that 
has been used for all ports completed as of this writing. &nbsp;Also, we feel
that it's no more difficult than any of the alternatives.<br>
  <br>
  Here are some brief notes on alternative approaches:<br>
   
<ul>
    <li>Using a coss-compiler. &nbsp;This requires making a cross-compiling
 build environment (<tt>std_env</tt>) for executing tools on an already-working
 platform and building for the target of the port. &nbsp;Creating a native
 build environment for the target platform is a significant amount of the
work of any complete port of Vesta (where Vesta can be built using itself
on the target platform). &nbsp;Therefore, this is probably more work than
the boot-strapping  approach. &nbsp;However, if you intend to cross-compile
for the target platform  using Vesta anyway, this may be no extra work.</li>

    <li>Using another builder (e.g. <tt>make</tt>). &nbsp;We have
    recently put together

	<a href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/bridges/makefile_env">a method for automatically generating

    <tt>make</tt> build instructions for Vesta (or other C/C++
    programs built using Vesta)</a>.&nbsp; You can find several
    <tt>make</tt>-based source kits of Vesta

	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34164">available for download at
    SourceForge</a>.&nbsp;

	The main problem with this approach is that it <i>doesn't</i>
	avoid the cost of <a href="index.html#Make std_env">constructing a build
	environment for the target platform</a> (although it does
	allow one to delay it).&nbsp; A port cannot really be
	considered complete until Vesta can build itself with all
	components running on the new platform (which necessitates
	constructing a new build environment).&nbsp; Also, it means
	that during the port one has to work without the benefits of
	Vesta itself.</li>

    <li>Using binary compatibility/emulation to run the Vesta binaries from 
a working platform on the target platform. &nbsp;This may be possible in some
cases. &nbsp;However, Vesta's use of features such as garbage collection (which
usually makes highly platform-specific assumptions) and pthreads (which uses
system calls that may not be properly handled under a compatibility layer)
may make this approach difficult or impossible.<br>
    </li>
   
</ul>
     
<a name="Steps to Port by Boot-strapping"><h2>Steps to Port by
Boot-strapping</h2></a>
   
<a name="Install Vesta on the Host Platform"><h3>Install Vesta on the
Host Platform</h3></a>

 See the document "Getting Started With Vesta" for instructions on how to 
install it.<br>
 <br>
 The host will run all the Vesta servers, daemons, and clients until enough 
progress has been made to get those components functioning on the target platform.<br>
 
<a name="Set Up the Target as a Vesta Client"><h3>Set Up the Target as
a Vesta Client</h3></a>

 You'll need to have the machine running the target platform meet the requirements 
for a Vesta client node. &nbsp;Specifically, it will need to:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Share user and group information with the Vesta server (e.g. via NIS).</li>
   <li>Mount the directory where the Vesta servers store their data (<tt>/vesta-srv</tt>)</li>
   <li>Be given permission to acces the repository (in the repository's export 
file)</li>
   <li>Have the repository mount points (<tt>/vesta</tt> and <tt>/vesta-work</tt>)</li>
 
</ul>
 
<a name="Port vmount"><h3>Port <tt>vmount</tt> and Mount the Repository on the Target Platform</h3></a>

<p>
 The repository provides an NFS server interface. &nbsp;However, because
it is not part of the normal OS-provided NFS server infrastructure, it can't 
be mounted with the normal methods (e.g. the <tt>mount(8)</tt> command or 
an entry in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>). &nbsp;Instead, a small program called <tt>vmount</tt> 
is used to make the appropriate <tt>mount</tt> system call.
</p>

<p>
 This program is small, written in straight C, and its source can be found 
in <a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount">the 
<tt>vmount</tt> package</a>. &nbsp;There are currently variants for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Linux (<a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount/latest/src/vmount_linux.c"><tt>vmount_linux.c</tt></a>)
</li>
<li>
Tru64 UNIX (<a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount/latest/src/vmount_tru64.c"><tt>vmount_tru64.c</tt></a>)
</li>
<li>
Solaris (<a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount/latest/src/vmount_solaris.c"><tt>vmount_solaris.c</tt></a>)
</li>
<li>
FreeBSD (<a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount/latest/src/vmount_freebsd.c"><tt>vmount_freebsd.c</tt></a>)
</li>
<li>
Darwin (MacOS X) (<a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/vmount/latest/src/vmount_darwin.c"><tt>vmount_darwin.c</tt></a>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The general approach is to take a copy of one of these and modify it 
to work on the target platform. &nbsp;(Unfortunately, the <tt>mount</tt> interface 
for NFS is not always well documented, which can make this step non-trivial.)
</p>

<p>
 Once <tt>vmount</tt> compiles correctly on the target platform, the repository 
can be mounted. &nbsp;You can invokve <tt>vmount</tt> directly, but an easier 
way to mount the repository is to modify a copy of <a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/repos/latest/src/mountrepos">the 
<tt>mountrepos</tt> script</a>, adding defaults for all variables set by calling
<tt>vgetconfig</tt>. &nbsp;For example:</p>
 
<blockquote>   
  <pre>NFS_host=`vgetconfig Repository NFS_host || echo "vesta.example.com"`<br>NFS_port=`vgetconfig Repository NFS_port || echo 21774`<br>AppendableRootName=`vgetconfig UserInterface AppendableRootName || echo "/vesta"`<br>MutableRootName=`vgetconfig UserInterface MutableRootName || echo "/vesta-work"`<br>VolatileRootName=`vgetconfig Run_Tool VolatileRootName || echo "/vesta-work/.volatile"`</pre>
 </blockquote>
 Of course the script may also need other minor modifications to work on
the target platform (e.g. the Linux-specific use of "<tt>mount -f</tt>").<br>
      
<a name="Port tool_launcher"><h3>Port the
<tt>tool_launcher</tt></h3></a>

 The <tt>tool_launcher</tt> is a small program which is responsible for making 
the chroot system call to encapsulate the filesystem used by a build step. 
&nbsp;Like <tt>vmount</tt>, it is small and written in C. &nbsp;Unlike vmount, 
building it for the target platform should be quite easy. &nbsp;(It's straightforward 
POSIX code, and doesn't even contain a single platform-specific <tt>#if</tt> 
as of this writing.)<br>
 <br>
 Its source can be found in <a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/run_tool">the 
<tt>run_tool</tt> package</a>. &nbsp;Specifically, there are two source files 
needed to compile it: <tt><a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/run_tool/latest/src/tool_launcher.c">tool_launcher.c</a></tt>, 
and <tt><a
 href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/run_tool/latest/src/Launcher.h">Launcher.h</a></tt>.<br>
 <br>
 Build this for the target platform and make it setuid root (so that it can 
execute the <tt>chroot</tt> system call).<br>
     
<a name="rsh hack"><h3>Set Up Remote Tool Execution</h3></a>

The <tt>RunToolServer</tt> is the daemon which accepts requests to execute
tools and invokes them in an encapsulated environment. &nbsp;When invoking
a tool it executes the <tt>tool_launcher</tt>. &nbsp;The location of the
<tt>tool_launcher</tt> executable is set by the configuration setting <tt>[Run_Tool]helper</tt>.<br>
<br>

Because of this configurability, we can run a <tt>RunToolServer</tt>
on the host platform with <tt>[Run_Tool]helper</tt> set to
<a href="run_remote_tool.sh">a script which executes the
<tt>tool_launcher</tt> on the target platform using <tt>rsh</tt> or
<tt>ssh</tt></a>.  &nbsp;(This method is sometimes referred to as "the
<tt>rsh</tt> hack".)  &nbsp;You should do this in a separate
configuration file that starts by including your normal configuraiton
file and then adds overrides, like so:<br>

<blockquote>
  <pre>// Include the normal vesta.cfg<br>[include /etc/vesta.cfg]<br><br>// Add overrides for remote tool execution<br>[Run_Tool]<br>helper = /foo/bar/run_remote_tool.sh<br><br>//...<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Before you start this <tt>RunToolServer</tt>, simply set the <tt>VESTACONFIG</tt>
environment variable to point to this alternate configuration file.<br>
<br>
The <tt>RunToolServer</tt> must also be configured to report that it is of
the host type of the target platform. &nbsp;This can be done by using other
configuration variables in the <tt>[Run_Tool]</tt> section. &nbsp;Their values
replace those normally acquired from the hose operating system. &nbsp;For
example, if the target platform is a PowerPC Linux system:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[Run_Tool]<br>sysname = Linux<br>machine = powerpc<br>release = 2.4.18<br>version = #1 Tue Oct 8 13:33:14 EDT 2002</pre>
</blockquote>
In most cases appropriate settings can be determined by <a
 href="run-tool-system-config.sh">running this simple shell script</a> on
the target platform.<br>
<br>
You will probably also need to change the port that the <tt>RunToolServer</tt>
runs on, which is controlled by <tt>[Run_Tool]SRPC_port</tt>. &nbsp;(If you're
not running a <tt>RunToolServer</tt> to run tools on the host platform, this
is not be neccessary.)<br>
<br>
Lastly, you'll need to add a section to your normal vesta.cfg which indicates
how to contact the RunToolServer for the target platform. &nbsp;Before doing
this you'll need to chose a "platform name", which is just a string used
to identify the system type needed to execute a tool request from the evaluatore.&nbsp;
Continuing with the above example, if the platform name chosen was "<tt>Linux2.4-PPC</tt>",
the platform section might look like this:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>[Linux2.4-PPC]<br>sysname = Linux<br>release = 2.4.*<br>version = *<br>machine = powerpc*<br>cpus    = 1<br>cpuMHz  = 0<br>memKB   = 0<br>hosts   = vesta.example.com:21786<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Once you've set this up, you should test it with a simple model that executes
a program on the target platform. &nbsp;A good simple test is to run a statically
linked "hello world" program on the target platform. &nbsp;Continuing with
the above example, an SDL model for testing the RunToolServer might look
like this:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>files<br>  hello_static;<br>{<br>  . = [ root = [ .WD = [ hello_static ],<br>		 dev/null = 0x0103,<br> 		 boot/kernel.h = "" ],<br> 	envVars = []<br>      ];<br><br>  return _run_tool("Linux2.4-PPC", &lt;"hello_static"&gt;);<br>}<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Once this simple test works correctly, you can move on to the next step of
preapring a full build environment for the target platform.<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that there is some minor loss of functionality when using
<tt>rsh</tt>. &nbsp;<tt>rsh</tt> doesn't propagate the exit status of the
remote command. &nbsp;It simply returns successful status if the command
is executed on the remote host. &nbsp;This causes the evaluator to cache
the tool invocation as though it were successful. &nbsp;To handle this situation
a little better, the C/C++ bridge has an option to not cache tool invocations
which write to standard error (by passing <tt>"report_nocache"</tt> for the
<tt>stderr_treatment</tt> argument of the <tt>_run_tool</tt> call). &nbsp;You
can turn this feature on in your top-level model like this:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>. ++= [ C/options/cache_stderr = FALSE,<br>        Cxx/options/cache_stderr = FALSE ];<br></pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="Make std_env"><h3>Construct a Build Environment for the
Porting Target</h3></a>

The build environment (also called the "standard environment" or <tt>std_env</tt>)
encapsulates all the files needed to perform compilations on a platform (compiler
binaries, library archives, etc.) as well as the SDL code needed to run them
to perform high-level operations (e.g. "construct an executable program from
these C++ source files").<br>
<br>

The general approach is to create a set of "OS component" or "kit"
packages, each of which contains a set of files from the target
operating system. &nbsp;When the OS has a component packaging system,
it's probably easiest to use its granularity. &nbsp;(For Linux we've
constructed build environments from both sets of RPM files and sets of
Debian packages.) &nbsp;With a little scripting, the process of
importing these OS components can usually be automated. &nbsp;You can
find scripts which have been used to import RPMs, Debian packages, and
Tru64 subsets in this Vesta package (which is available for
replication from
<tt><a href="http://pub.vestasys.org/">pub.vestasys.org</a></tt>):

    <blockquote>
      <a href="http://pub.vestasys.org/cgi-bin/vestaweb?path=/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/extras/pkg2vesta">/vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/extras/pkg2vesta</a>
    </blockquote>

In
cases where licensing restrictions disallow binary redistribution (and thus
replication of a build environment), making scripts for importing packages
available may be quite helpful for others wishing to build for the same target
platform.<br>
<br>
The bridges (code which insulates the average SDL writer from making
individual tool invocations) usually require only minimal changes to
work on a new platform.  &nbsp;If using a different compiler suite
(not the GNU C/C++ compiler), you may need to make changes to the
<tt>c_like</tt> bridge.<br>
<br>
The remainder (the top-level <tt>std_env</tt> model, the handling of various
libraries) is written by hand, but is fairly small. &nbsp;(The x86 Linux
<tt>std_env</tt> is under 500 lines total, over 150 of which is comments.)<br>
<br>
In general, studying one of the existing build environments and using it
as an example is the best approach.<br>
<br>
Once you believe you have a working std_env for your porting target, you
should test it by building some simple programs (such as the "hello world"
examples in <tt>/vesta/vestasys.org/examples</tt>). &nbsp;Once those build
correctly you can move on to building the low-level components of Vesta.<br>
     
<a name="Port Vesta"><h3>Port and Test Vesta</h3></a>

At this point you can simply work your way through the various
libraries and programs that make up Vesta. &nbsp;As with any other
porting project, you'll probably need to make some code changes to get
it to compile. &nbsp;Once the components compile, they'll require some
testing to verify that they're funcitoning correctly on the new
platform. &nbsp;Here is an illustration of the dependencies between
the different components:<br>

<blockquote>
<img src="dependency-map.gif" alt="Dependency map">
</blockquote>
Many of the packages come with test programs which can help you determine
whether they are functioning correctly.<br>
<br>
Some notable milestones in the progress of a port:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Once you get the <tt>config</tt> library working, you should be able
to start using <tt>vgetconfig</tt> on the porting target, and thus be able
to use the normal <tt>mountrepos</tt> script.</li>
  <li>When the <tt>RunToolServer</tt> works on the target platform, you can
dispense with the remote tool execution method described above.</li>
  <li>When the <tt>repos_ui</tt> programs work, you can perform repository
operations (e.g. checkout, checkin) from the porting target.</li>
  <li>When the evaluator works, you can run builds on the porting target.
&nbsp;(Alernating between the host and porting target platforms is a good
idea, to make sure that cache entreis are correctly shared between them.)</li>
</ul>

<p>

Once all components seem to run on the target platform, you should try
a more extensive test of Vesta. &nbsp;You can find a Perl script that
can be used to test the most common aspects of Vesta in this package
(which is available for replication from

<tt><a href="http://pub.vestasys.org/">pub.vestasys.org</a></tt>):

<p>

(The script itself does have a few platform-specific pieces that may
also need some work on a new platform.)

</p>

<a name="Potential Problem Areas"><h2>Potential Problem Areas</h2></a>

     There are, of course, a few areas that could cause trouble in a port,
and are worth mentioning.<br>

<a name="64-bit Ints"><h3>64-bit Integers</h3></a>

   Vesta was developed on a 64-bit platform. &nbsp;In several places, its
source code relies on having a 64-bit integer type. &nbsp;(See the definitions
of the types <tt>Basics::int64</tt> and <tt>Basics::uint64</tt> in <tt>Basics.H</tt>.)
&nbsp;So far, we've simply used the "<tt>long long</tt>" type provided by
the GNU C/C++ compiler on 32-bit platforms. &nbsp;If you need to use another
compiler for some reason, this could be a problem.<br>
<br>
In addition to a 64-bit integer type, a few parts of the Vesta code also
need to format 64-bit integers with the <tt>printf</tt>/<tt>sprintf</tt>
family of functions. &nbsp;On Linux, we've used <tt>glibc</tt>'s "<tt>ll</tt>"
length specifier. &nbsp;(See the definition of the <tt>FORMAT_LENGTH_INT_64</tt>
in <tt>Basics.H</tt>.) &nbsp;This may prove difficult or impossible with
other C run-time libraries, necessitating more significant changes.<br>

<a name="pthreads Quirks"><h3><tt>pthreads</tt> Quirks</h3></a>

   When porting Vesta to Linux, we had to make some changes to accomodate
its implementation of <tt>pthreads</tt>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <tt>RunToolServer</tt> used to have one thread <tt>fork</tt> a
child process and then have a different thread call <tt>waitpid</tt> for
that child. &nbsp;Because Linux threads are really processes, only the <tt>fork</tt>ing
thread could wait for the child.</li>
  <li>Regardless of whether a program ever creates a new thread, just including
the <tt>pthread.h</tt> header changed the definition of <tt>errno</tt> (using
a pre-processor macro) to call a function. &nbsp;Because of the way that
function is defined, we had to pass a linker option to force the <tt>pthread</tt>
library to be linked into the executable. &nbsp;(Without doing this, any
access of <tt>errno</tt> by programs that don't create pthreads would crash.)</li>
  <li>The signal handler in the <tt>RunToolServer</tt> (for <tt>INT</tt>
and <tt>TERM</tt>) had to be changed to take action only in the main thread.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Boehm collector on Linux holds an allocation lock during blocking
reads. &nbsp;To avoid blocking on memory allocation while waiting on network
traffic, we had to insert a <tt>select</tt> before reading from a TCP socket.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Other implementations of <tt>pthreads</tt> will probably have subtle quirks
of their own requiring other changes.<br>

<a name="NFS Quirks"><h3>NFS Client Quirks</h3></a>

   Different NFS client implementations have subtle differences. &nbsp;Several
changes have been made to the repository's NFS implementation to adequately
support the Linux NFS client. &nbsp;Inter-operating with other NFS clients
may require additional changes.<br>

<a name="Threaded GC"><h3>Garbage Collection With Support for
Multi-Threading</h3></a>

<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">The Boehm
garbage collector</a> may not be well tested in multi-threaded
programs on all platforms. &nbsp;(In some cases it may not be
supported at all.) &nbsp;This is a neccessity for both the evaluator
and the cache server, which rely heavily on both multi-threading
<i>and</i> garbage collection.<br>
<br>
Even if it is fully suppoted, there may be subtle issues to deal with (such
as the issue with blocking reads mentioned above).<br>

<a name="OS-Specific Information Gathering"><h3>OS-Specific
Information Gathering in <tt>RunToolServer</tt> and Cache
Server</h3></a>

   The <tt>RunToolServer</tt> gathers some information about the hardware
it's running on. &nbsp;Specifically, it determines the number of CPUs, the
CPU clock speed, and the amount of physical memory. &nbsp;These values are
used to allow selection of the host to run tools on based on these details.
&nbsp;(In some cases, certain tool invocations may be known to use large
amounts of memory, and this can be used to avoid running those tools on machines
with less than a certain threshold of physical memory.)<br>
<br>
The cache serve also gets informations from the operating system on how much
memory it is using (primarily for reporting to statistics gather clients
such as <tt>VCacheMonitor</tt>).<br>
<br>
Both of these areas will require attention when porting to a new operating
system.<br>

<a name="Troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2></a>

<p>

When bringing up a new platform under Vesta, and particularly during
the development of its build environment, there are often some tricky
problems to deal with.  This section provides a few hints on
debugging this kind of problem.

</p>

<a name="Tool Misbehavior"><h3>Tool Misbehavior</h3></a>

<p>

If tools such as the compiler or linker fail in unexpected ways, it
may be due to some file missing from the encapsulated filesystem.

</p>

<p>

The evaluator has

<a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#debug-options">some debug
options</a> which can be helpful in understanding such problems.
Specifically, the <tt>-evalcalls</tt> flag prints a message for each
attempted access in the encapsulated filesystem, including attempts to
access files that don't exist.  This can often provide important clues
when something is missing from the tool invocation's root directory.

</p>

<p>

Additionally, <a href="../man/html/RunToolServer.1.html">the
RunToolServer</a> has some debug capabilities controlled by
environment variables.  (These require restarting the RunToolServer to
activate them.)  The most useful is turned on by setting the
<tt>STOP_BEFORE_TOOL</tt> environment variable.  This causes the
RunToolServer to print the path to the volatile directory just before
launching each tool and wait for the user to press return before
continuing.  This allows one to examine the contents of the
encapsulated filesystem before the tool is executed.  There's also
<tt>STOP_AFTER_TOOL</tt> which may also be helpful, plus a couple
others.

</p>

<a name="Evaluator Misbehavior"><h3>Evaluator Misbehavior</h3></a>

<p>

It's possible that you may find that

<a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html">the evaluator</a>
behaves incorrectly on a new platform.  Here are a few suggestions on
debugging such problems:

</p>

<ul>

<li>
Turning off the evaluator's multi-threading capabilities (with

&quot;<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#eval-options">-maxthreads</a>

1</tt>&quot; or by setting

<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#configuration">[Evaluator]MaxThreads</a></tt>

to 1) can make the evaluator's behavior more predictable.  While this
probably won't solve problems, it may make them easier to debug.
</li>

<li>

The

&quot;<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#debug-options">-trace</a></tt>&quot;

option may be useful in understanding the caching behavior of an
evaluation, including one that's not working correctly.
</li>

<li>

You can prevent the evaluator from adding new entries to the cache
without turning off its use of existing entries in the cache with 

&quot;<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#cache-options">-noaddentry</a></tt>&quot;.

</li>

<li>

You can completely turn off the evaluator's use of the cache server
with

&quot;<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#cache-options">-cache</a>
none</tt>&quot;.  This will definitely make evaluations take longer
(because they will re-do work), but if there's a bug in the interface
to the cache (including fingerprint computation or collection of
secondary dependencies), it could change the result of the evaluation.
There are also two intermediate caching options (&quot;<tt>-cache
runtool</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>-cache model</tt>&quot;).
</li>

<li>

To get the complete details of the evaluator's interaction with the
cache server, use
&quot;<tt><a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html#cache-options">-cdebug</a>
All</tt>&quot;.

</li>

</ul>
