<H2>About This Document</H2>

<p>

The following comparison was written by the original Vesta developers
some time ago.  It compares and contrasts Vesta to RCS, CVS, and Make.


Today there are many other alternatives available.  Like Vesta, they
each try to address some of the failings of older systems
(e.g. RCS/CVS+Make).


Unfortunately, the current Vesta maintainers haven't found the time to
get familiar enough with these new options to provide an in-depth
analysis of the pros and cons of the modern alternatives.

</p>

<p>

The comparison below is still worth reading.  You might find also find

<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/comparison/"> Shlomi Fish' &quot;Better SCM&quot; comparison</a>

useful.  It compares several modern versioning systems, including
Vesta.  (Unlike the comparison on this page, it <em>doesn't</em> cover
building.)

<H2>Assessment of Various SCM Systems</H2>

<P>This document attempts to assess the pros and cons of various
software configuration management (SCM) systems. It is intended to be
used by organizations evaluating whether or not Vesta is suitable to
their needs. As with any such assessment, whether to classify an item
as a pro for one system or a con of another is a subjective decision.

<P>The core SCM domain can be roughly divided into four areas:
<DL>
<DT><B>Versioning</B></DT>
<DD>Versioning is the facility for assigning version numbers to
(collections of) source files.</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Source Control</B></DT>
<DD>Source control is the mechanism by which new versions are checked
out and checked in.</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Configuration Management</B></DT>
<DD>A software artifact consists of multiple components, each of which
is built from some (versions of) the sources. Configuration management
is the mechanism for specifying which components go together to make
the final artifact.</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Building</B></DT>
<DD>Building is the process for turning sources into derived files.</DD>
</DL>
For each of the SCM systems evaluated below, we indicate which of
these four areas it addresses.

<P>This document covers the following SCM systems:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="comparison.html#RCS">RCS</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="comparison.html#CVS">CVS</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="comparison.html#Make">Make</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="comparison.html#Vesta">Vesta</A></LI>
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME=RCS>RCS</A> (Revision Control System)</H2>

<P>RCS handles versioning and source control. It is often used in
conjunction with <A HREF="comparison.html#Make">Make</A>.</P>

<H3>Pros</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>simple</I></LI>
<P>
<LI><I>well-documented</I></LI>
</UL>

<H3>Cons</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I><A NAME="RCS-CheckoutReqd">no direct access to older
versions</A></I></LI>
<P>In RCS, a separate checkout step is required to access an
older version of a file. Hence, older versions are not directly
accessible to tools like text editors. By default, the tools
check out all versions under the same name, so it is a bit
awkward to examine two versions of a file at once, although a
special RCS-aware version of diff (<I>rcsdiff</I>) is provided
that can compare two versions without checking them out.
</P>
<LI><I>awkward tagging facilities</I></LI>
<P>In RCS, the unit of check-in/-out is the file. To keep track of
which versions of all files go together, the user can attach the same
tag to the files. But the whole tagging facility is somewhat awkward.
</P>
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME=CVS>CVS</A> (Concurrent Version System)</H2>

<P>CVS handles versioning and source control. It is often used in
conjunction with <A HREF="comparison.html#Make">Make</A>.</P>

<H3>Pros</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>well-documented</I></LI>
<P>
<LI><I>unit of check-in/-out is the module, an arbitrary directory
tree</I></LI>
<P>Portions of a module (such as subdirectories or groups of files)
may also be checked out, but most often, modules are checked out in
their entirety.
</P>
<LI><I>division of sources into modules is less important due to
support for concurrent updates</I></LI>
<P>In CVS, any developer can edit any file at any time. Hence, the
division of files into modules is less important than if only one
developer could be editing the files in a module at once. Some CVS
operations do cause individual files to be locked for short periods of
time, but for the most part developers may edit files and perform CVS
operations on them freely.
</P>
<LI><I>support for vendor releases</I></LI>
<P>Vendor releases can be checked into CVS and tagged as such. The
normal differencing tools can then be used to import the release
(paying careful attention to the resulting &quot;merge&quot; reports!).
</P>
<LI><I>support for remote access</I></LI>
<P>CVS supports the ability for updates to be performed on a source
repository from geographically remote locations.
</P>
</UL>

<H3>Cons</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I><A NAME="CVS-CheckoutReqd">no direct access to older
versions</A></I></LI>
<P>As in <A HREF="comparison.html#RCS-CheckoutReqd">RCS</A>, a separate checkout step
is required to access older source versions.
</P>
<LI><I>conflict detection is simple-minded</I></LI>
<P>Because CVS allows multiple developers to modify the same file
concurrently, it must detect conflicting edits to the same file.
However, the algorithm it uses is based on diff3, a line-based
tool.
</P>
<LI><I>semantic conflicts may go undetected</I></LI>
<P>If CVS does not detect a conflict, it silently merges the changes
made by multiple developers. As a result, some true conflicts may go
undetected.
</P>
<LI><I>conflicts can be difficult to resolve when they occur</I></LI>
<P>This problem is just a fact of life when multiple developers can
edit files at will within the same module. CVS proponents claim that
true conflicts are rare, but they definitely do occur, and when they
occur, the cost of both detecting and correcting them is quite high.
</P>
<LI><I>check-in/-out not atomic with respect to each other</I></LI>
<P>If user <I>A</I> is checking in a module at the same time that user
<I>B</I> is checking out that module, user <I>B</I> may get some
older file versions and some of the newer ones that <I>A</I> is
checking in. Moreover, CVS provides no indication to <I>B</I> that he
has checked out an inconsistent version of the module, so <I>B</I> has
no way of knowing to repeat the checkout operation. These points are
described in the <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_10.html#SEC88">on-line CVS documentation</A>.
</P>
<LI><I>check-in/-out can be slow</I></LI>
<P>Because check-in and check-out copy files between a user's local
work area and the central repository, the time required for
check-in/-out is proportional to the number of files that must be
copied. In typical usage, only a portion of a module must be copied.
However, there are occasions when whole modules must be copied; in
those cases, check-in and check-out can be time-consuming operations.
</P>
<LI><I>tagging a module can be slow</I></LI>
<P>When a module is tagged, say for a release, each of the files in
the module must be updated. This can be a slow operation.
</P>
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME=Make>Make</A></H2>

<P>Make handles configuration management (without explicit version
numbers) and building. It is often used in conjunction with <A HREF="comparison.html#RCS">RCS</A> or <A HREF="comparison.html#CVS">CVS</A>.</P>

<H3>Pros</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>widely used</I></LI>
<P>
<LI><I>simple syntax (although somewhat cryptic)</I></LI>
<P>
<LI><I>easy to use</I></LI>
<P>
<LI><I>can be adapted to tasks other than building software</I></LI>
<P>For example, Make can be used to &quot;build&quot; documents by invoking
LaTeX and dvips.
</P>
</UL>

<H3>Cons</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I><A NAME="make-scale">scales poorly</A></I></LI>
<P>Ignoring the time spent outside of Make proper running the actual
build tools, the time required by Make to do a build is proportional
to the size of the software being built, not to the amount of
incremental work that must be done.
</P>
<LI><I>dependencies must be specified explicitly</I></LI>
<P>Dependencies of objects on the sources from which they were built
must be listed in the Makefile. This is a completely manual process.
Tools like makedepend(1) help, but makedepend suffers from several
problems: it is slow, it works only for C/C++ sources, it does not
detect all dependencies (e.g., dependencies on tools or other
non-C/C++ files read during the build), and it must still be run by
hand. Because it is slow, developers tend not to run makedepend as
often as they should. As a result, the potential for producing an
inconsistent build is increased.
</P>
<LI><I>many dependencies are inexpressible or simply too costly to
express</I></LI>
<P>An example of an inexpressible dependency is a dependency on the
value of an environment variable read during the build. An example of
a dependency that is too costly to express is a dependency on the
Makefile itself; this dependency is usually omitted because it would
cause all derived files to appear stale any time even an
inconsequential edit was made to the Makefile. Because the dependency
is omitted, developers must often delete a subset of their derived
files to force a recompilation whenever they change the Makefile
instructions to build those files. This process is quite error-prone.
</P>
<LI><I>missing/incorrect dependencies can lead to inconsistent
builds</I></LI>
<P>An <I>inconsistent build</I> results when one component of a software
system was compiled against one version of a source, and another
component was compiled against a different version of that source. The
resulting software system may fail to operate or, even worse, it may
run but have mysterious bugs. Because Make's dependency mechanism has
the problems listed above, the only guaranteed way to produce a
consistent build using Make is to do it from scratch.
</P>
<LI><I>Make's language is too limited</I></LI>
<P>The downside of using a simple language is that all of Make's
operations are quite low-level. The Make language does not include
any facility for defining more abstract, high-level building
operations. To make up for this deficit, people have written tools
like smake and imake, but they are awkward to use and require an extra
processing step.
</P>
<LI><I><A NAME="Make-NoVersioning">little or no integration with
versioning tools</A></I></LI>
<P>Some variants of Make are integrated with RCS to the extent that
Make can be made to check out the latest version of a source file if it
does not exist in the source directory. But version numbers are still
completely absent from most Makefiles. Hence, configuration management
must be done by hand: to build some arbitrary configuration, the user
must manually check out all the right versions of the sources before
invoking make on them.
</P>
<LI><I>dependency analysis based on timestamps is problematic</I></LI>
<P>Make's test that a derived file has become stale is based on the
last-modified times of the derived file and all of the sources
contributing to it. This is problematic, especially when building from
older source versions. After checking out older source versions, the
timestamps of the sources will most likely precede that of the derived
file, so Make will think the derived file is up-to-date! The
developer's only recourse in that situation is to manually delete the
derived files and perform a scratch build.
</P>
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME=Vesta>Vesta</A></H2>

<P>Vesta handles versioning, source control, configuration management
(with explicit version numbers), and building.</P>

<H3>Pros</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>repeatability</I></LI>
<P>Any piece of software that has been built before can be built
<I>identically</I> again.
</P>
<LI><I>automatic dependency detection - no more makedepend!</I></LI>
<P>Vesta detects all dependencies automatically, including dependencies
on build tools and the build instructions themselves. It also detects
dependencies on the <I>non</I>-existence of files, an important
property.
</P>
<LI><I>guaranteed consistency</I></LI> <P>In principle, every Vesta
build is done from scratch. In practice, Vesta's caching technology is
used to make all builds incremental. But because Vesta detects all
dependencies automatically, the software artifacts produced by Vesta
are guaranteed to be consistent.
</P>
<LI><I>builder is integrated with the version control system</I></LI>
<P>In Vesta, the build instructions name particular versions of all the
sources that contribute to the build. Hence, in contrast to <A HREF="comparison.html#Make-NoVersioning">Make</A>, Vesta does true configuration
management. Because sources are versioned at the granularity of
packages, and because most file references are within a package (in
which case no version number need be specified), specifying version
numbers in Vesta is not unduly burdensome.
</P>
<LI><I>better performance than Make</I></LI>
<P>Vesta outperforms Make, especially on incremental builds. The
larger the software you are building, the better Vesta looks in
comparison to Make. The main reason for Vesta's advantage is that the time
spent in the Vesta builder is proportional to the incremental amount of
building work required, not to the size of the software being built,
<A HREF="comparison.html#make-scale">as in Make</A>.
</P>
<LI><I>designed to scale to large software</I></LI>
<P>The entire Vesta system was designed with an eye toward
scalability, both in the size of the software to be built and in the
number of developers it can support. The system was designed to build
systems containing 20 million lines of code, but it still works quite
well on even modest-sized programs.
</P>
<LI><I><A NAME=flexibility>flexible system modeling language</A></I></LI>
<P>In Vesta, the build instructions take the form of a program written
in the Vesta system modeling language, a functional programming
language. Hence, it is easy to define new functions representing
high-level build operations. The build description for a large,
complex system can thus be made much simpler and more maintainable by
splitting it into many small, parameterized, reusable modules.
</P>
<LI><I><A NAME="vesta-multi">good support for parallel development
by multiple developers</A></I></LI>
<P>In Vesta, each developer has control over when he sees new versions
produced by other developers. This property allows each developer to work
productively in isolation, without being hampered by untimely changes
made by others. Vesta also makes it easy for a developer to see how his
changes to a local component affect the build of the entire system,
again without affecting the progress of other developers.
</P>
<LI><I>site-wide cache means developers benefit from each others'
builds</I></LI>
<P>Vesta's single site-wide cache &quot;remembers&quot; the build work done by
every developer. Since the cache is shared by all developers at the same
site, they can benefit from each others' builds. Moreover, the work
done by a developer during a checkout session can be re-used during
a complete release build after the checkout session is over -- so
release builds are often very quick.
</P>
<LI><I>customized builds</I></LI>
<P>The <A HREF="comparison.html#flexibility">flexibility</A> of the Vesta system
modeling language allows the &quot;bridges&quot; to the construction tools to
be highly parameterized, thereby allowing a wide variety of customized
builds to be supported. Example customizations include overriding
which package versions are used in a build and overriding the
command-line switches used to build the entire program, a library, or
even a single file.
</P>
<LI><I><A NAME="derived-mgmt">derived files are managed
automatically</A></I></LI>
<P>Derived files produced during the course of a build are managed
automatically by Vesta. The final results of the build can easily be
copied out of Vesta into a standard file system.
</P>
<LI><I>multi-target builds</I></LI>
<P>Because Vesta <A  HREF="comparison.html#derived-mgmt">manages derived files
automatically</A>, building for multiple target platforms is easier.
The target platform is one of the parameters to the build
process.
</P>
<LI><I>direct access to older versions</I></LI> <P>Older source
versions can be accessed directly by all standard tools through a
filesystem interface; no separate checkout step is required to access
older source versions as in <A
HREF="comparison.html#RCS-CheckoutReqd">RCS</A> and <A
HREF="comparison.html#CVS-CheckoutReqd">CVS</A>.
</P>
<LI><I><A NAME=attributes>repository attributes</A></I></LI> <P>The
repository allows arbitrary name-value pairs to be associated with
package versions and other directories. By default, the repository
tools tag directories with attributes such as the time and date of
check-out/-in, the person performing the operation, the previous
version on which the changes were based, and change log
messages. Attributes could also be used to tag package versions with,
for example, quality assurance labels. Attributes can be read and set
from the command-line using the <A
HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib(1)</A> program.
</P>
<LI><I>fast check-in/-out</I></LI>
<P>Check-in and check-out in Vesta are nearly instantaneous,
regardless of the number of files in the package. The Vesta repository
is able to achieve this speed because it also manages the user's
mutable copy of the package, using copy-on-write techniques; the
repository physically copies a file only when it is modified.
</P>

<LI><I>sophisticated support for code sharing among multiple sites</I></LI>

<P>
Vesta includes several features that enable groups at geographically
distributed sites to do shared development.  There is <a
href="man/html/vrepl.1.html">a flexible tool for replicating
sources between repositories</a>. When a user at site <i>A</i> wishes
to check out a package whose master copy is at site <i>B</i>, <a
href="man/html/vcheckout.1.html">the checkout tool</a>
automatically contacts the remote repository to request permission for
the checkout.  When the user checks in a new version, it is
automatically replicated back to the master site by <a
href="man/html/vcheckin.1.html">the checkin tool</a>. There is also
<a href="man/html/vmaster.1.html">another tool for transferring
mastership</a> of individual packages or entire hierarchies to another
repository.
</P>

</UL>

<H3>Cons</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>not widely used</I></LI>

<p>

Vesta has spent the majority of its life as an internal research
project in Digital/Compaq.  Until 2001, it was only used by its
developers and one significant Compaq-internal customer (the Alpha
microprocessor group).

</p>

<p>

Though Vesta is now available as free software, it gets the most use
at Intel (which acquired the Alpha microprocessor group in 2001).  It
is not as widely used as some other alternatives.

</p>

<LI><I>no guaranteed support</I></LI>

<P>Vesta is the result of a years-long research project. It is not
sold by a commercial vendor, nor is it bundled with commercial system
software, so its continued support cannot be guaranteed. On the other
hand, with the release of Vesta as free software, a self-supporting
community of users and co-developers has the chance to grow, and even
in the worst case users have access to the Vesta source code and can
maintain it themselves.
</P>

<LI><I>user guide needed</I></LI>

<P>
A user guide is needed to instruct users on the Vesta methodology (see
<A HREF="comparison.html#methodology">next point</A>).&nbsp; The set
of documentation available continues to grow, but remains a little
limited on the introductory end of the spectrum.&nbsp; The
documentation avilable includes:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="getting-started.html">Installation and setup instructions</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="tutorial.html">A tutorial</a> that leads the user through
creating a package and building a simple program
</li>

<li>
Complete <A HREF="../index.html#man-pages">man pages</A> for all of the Vesta
tools, as well as <a href="command-summary.html">a summary of how to
use common Vesta commands</a>
</li>

<li>
Both a <a href="sdl-ref/index.html">programmer's guide</a> to the system
modeling language and <A HREF="sdl-spec/index.html">a more precise
specification</A> of its syntax and semantics
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094525/http://gatekeeper.research.compaq.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/abstracts/src-rr-177.html">A
detailed research report</a> describing the entire system
</li>

</ul>

<p>
This is perhaps less of a <i>con</i> than it was when this comparison
was first written, but Vesta could still benefit from a more
user-oriented overview of the entire system and
<A HREF="comparison.html#methodology">its methodology</a>.
</P>

<LI><I><A NAME=methodology>training is required to learn the Vesta
methodology</A></I></LI>
<P>The Vesta methodology of building against
immutable sources using complete build descriptions is rather
different from what people are used to, so some training will be
required for people to learn the Vesta tools and the rudiments of
Vesta's system modeling language. As for the language, we expect that
only a small number of people at a site will have to learn the
language in any detail; most developers' system description files will
take the form of highly stylized templates, and with a little
investment can be manipulated solely through scripts or custom
GUIs. Hence, most Vesta users should require very little understanding
of the language.
</P>

<LI>
<p>
<I>Limited platform support; porting is not striaghtforward</I>
</p>

<P>
As of this writing, Vesta runs on the following platforms:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<i>Linux</i> with at least a 2.4 kernel on the following CPU
architectures:
</li>

<ul>

<li><i>IA-32 compatible processors</i> (Intel, AMD, Cyrix, etc.) </li>

<li><i>Alpha</i></li>

<li><i>PowerPC</i> (ported and tested on a 603e)</li>

<li><i>Sparc</i> (ported and tested on a 32-bit micro-Sparc)</li>

</ul>

<li>
<i>Compaq Tru64 UNIX on Alpha</i>, versions 4.0D through 4.0G.
(It has not been tested on 5.0 or 5.1.)
</li>

</ul>

<p>
We attempted to make Vesta as portable as possible, so we believe it
will not be difficult to port Vesta to other variants of UNIX.
However, porting is complicated by the fact that Vesta is built using
itself.  (No <tt>make</tt> instructions for building it exist.)  For
the ports to Alpha and IA-32 Linux, we used a boot-strapping approach
with a Tru64 system &quot;hosting&quot; the port.  (We plan on
documenting this porting methodology in the near future.)
</P>

</LI>

<LI><I>requires a small amount of administration to do
weeding</I></LI>

<P>Although Vesta <A HREF="comparison.html#derived-mgmt">manages
derived files automatically</A>, a program called <a
href="man/html/VestaWeed.1.html">the <I>weeder</I></a> must be run
occasionally to delete unwanted derived files when the disk gets full.
The frequency with which the weeder needs to be run depends on how
quickly the backing disk fills up. Here are two data points:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Using a relatively small (4GB)
disk and with three people doing active development, we found it
necessary to run the weeder once every two weeks or so. On that size
disk, weeding takes 10-15 minutes. </li>

<li> Another site used a much larger disk (100GB) with 100-150 active
developer.  They found it necessary to run the weeder about once a
week, and the weeder would run for more than an hour.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Weeding can be automated using <tt>cron</tt>(8), and Vesta builds can
still be performed while weeding is in progress; thus the weeder
really imposes little administrative burden, and it has no noticeable
impact on the average user.

</P>

<LI><I>few high-level tools written for &quot;querying&quot; the source
repository</I></LI>
<P>We have written relatively few high-level tools for performing
queries on the source repository, such as, for example, asking which
files have been checked in over the last 24 hours. We expect that such
tools would be relatively easy to write. Such tools might also exploit
the user-defined attribute values <A HREF="comparison.html#attributes">described
above</A>.
</P>

<LI><I>locking is at the granularity of packages</I></LI>
<P>As opposed to <A HREF="comparison.html#RCS">RCS</A>, locking in Vesta is at the
granularity of collections of files called <I>packages</I>. This
approach has its advantages, but is unfamiliar to most people. When
two developers need to change files in the same package concurrently,
at least one must create a branch in the version number sequence. This
can become burdensome if it needs to be done often, though it can
usually be avoided by a careful choice (and readjustment if
necessary) of package boundaries.
</P>

<LI><I>no way to force developers to build against the latest
version</I></LI>
<P>One consequence of Vesta's support for
<A HREF="comparison.html#vesta-multi">multiple developers</A> is that there is no way
to actually <I>force</I> all developers to build against the latest
version of some package. In the Vesta group, we simply announce the
availability of new package versions on a central bboard, and each
project member then invokes the
<A HREF="man/html/vupdate.1.html">vupdate(1)</A> tool to pick up the latest version when he is ready
for it. Stronger means of encouraging developers to run vupdate could
easily be added, but we believe it would negate one of Vesta's
greatest strengths if developers could be forced to take new versions
before they were ready to accept them.
</P>

<LI><I>poor support for &quot;incremental&quot; tools</I></LI>

<P>A tool is <I>incremental</I> if it reads and overwrites a derived
file that it produced during a previous build. For example, the Unix
<I>ar</I> tool can be invoked with switches that cause it to
incrementally rewrite a library archive. Incremental tools run counter
to the entire Vesta approach: Vesta can guarantee that all builds are
repeatable only because the instructions for building an artifact say
how that artifact should be built from scratch. But incremental tools
require that the inputs to a build step are based on the results of a
previous build. Hence, Vesta does not support incremental tools very
well.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that one cannot use tools in an incremental mode
under Vesta, just that it is inconvenient and sometimes inefficient to
do so.
</P>
