See the <A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page's
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section
for definitions of terms, and its
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A>
section for an explanation of how names are looked up.<P>

The <B>vadvance</B> command cleans up and snapshots the contents of a working
directory to form the next version in a Vesta checkout session.<P>

In more detail: <B>vadvance</B>'s cleanup phase walks the directory tree
rooted at <I>work-dir</I>.
If the last arc of any file's name matches one of the patterns in
<I>junk</I>, the file is deleted.  Here <I>junk</I> is a
space-separated list of <B>glob</B>(3) patterns.  If a file 
added since the last advance is larger
than <I>maxsize</I>, <B>vadvance</B> exits with an error message upon
encountering it.  Next, by default, <B>vadvance</B> checks whether
anything under <I>work-dir</I> has changed since the last advance; if
not, it exits with an informational message.  Finally, <B>vadvance</B>'s
snapshot phase binds <I>session-dir</I><TT>/</TT><I>session-ver-arc</I> to a
new immutable directory that is a copy of the mutable directory
<I>work-dir</I>, and then sets the <TT>session-ver-arc</TT> attribute of
<I>work-dir</I> to <I>session-ver-arc</I>.<P>

<IMG SRC="vadvance.gif" ALT="vadvance figure"
WIDTH=436 HEIGHT=427 BORDER=0>
<P>

You must have read and write access to <I>work-dir</I> and 
write access to <I>session-dir</I>.
The newly created snapshot is owned by you, but
has access permissions inherited from
<I>session-dir</I>.<P>

Without the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-t">-t</A> flag, <B>vadvance</B> returns status 0 if
the advance was successful or if no advance was performed because
nothing changed, 1 for parameter syntax errors, or 2 for more serious
errors.  See the description of <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-t">-t</A> below for how it affects
the exit status.  (Note that if any of the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Triggers">trigger
commands</A> fail, <B>vadvance</B> returns status 2.)<P>

<A NAME="renamed-work-dir">If <I>work-dir</I> has been renamed,
<B>vadvance</B> will silently re-connect it to <I>session-dir</I> and any
version reservation.  (To be specific, it checks whether <I>work-dir</I>
matches the "<TT>work-dir</TT>" attribute on <I>session-dir</I> and the
version reservation pointed to by the "<TT>new-version</TT>" attribute of
<I>work-dir</I>, if any.  If they don't match, it corrects those
"<TT>work-dir</TT>" attributes.)  So if you rename a <I>work-dir</I>, just
run <B>vadvance</B> on it to update the "<TT>work-dir</TT>" attributes which
link to it from these other objects.  With either the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-t">-t</A>
or <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-Q">-Q</A> flag, it will <I>not</I> correct the "<TT>work-dir</TT>"
attributes.</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-q">-q</A><DD>
Quiet; suppress printing out what is being done.
<DT><A NAME="-Q">-Q</A><DD>
Query; print out what the command would do, but don't do it.  (Note
that this disables running any <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Triggers">triggers</A> you have
configured.)
<DT><A NAME="-t">-t</A><DD>
Test; exit with 0 status only if no advance would be performed because
nothing changed.  Exit with 255 if the working directory has been modified.
Implies -Q.
<DT><A NAME="-w">-w</A> <I>work-dir</I><DD>
The mutable working directory to snapshot to produce the new version.
If you place this option last on the command line, you can omit the -w.
If the name <I>work-dir</I> is 
unqualified (does not have "<TT>/</TT>", "<TT>.</TT>", or "<TT>..</TT>" as its first arc),
it is interpreted relative
to <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration"><I>DefaultWorkParent</I></A><TT>/</TT><I>user</I>,
where <I>user</I> is your local user name.
Defaults to the current directory, or if <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-s">-s</A> is not used
and the current directory has no <TT>session-dir</TT> attribute, the
nearest parent directory with a non-empty <TT>session-dir</TT> attribute.
<DT><A NAME="-s">-s</A> <I>session-dir</I><DD>
The session directory that will hold the new version.
If the name <I>session-dir</I> is unqualified,
it is interpreted relative to the
site's default directory of packages, 
<A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration"><I>DefaultPackageParent</I></A>.  
Defaults to the <TT>session-dir</TT>
attribute of <I>work-dir</I>, if any.
<DT><A NAME="-a">-a</A> <I>session-ver-arc</I><DD>
The new version in the session directory.  Must be a single arc (i.e.,
must contain no "<TT>/</TT>" characters).
Defaults to the highest version
number bound in <I>session-dir</I> plus 1.  That is, <I>session-dir</I> is searched
for arcs consisting entirely of decimal digits, the one with the highest value
is chosen, and it is incremented by 1 to obtain the default.  
If no such arcs are found, the default is set to <TT>1</TT>.
<DT><A NAME="-f">-f</A><DD>
Force; omit sanity checking.
If the -f flag is not given:
<UL>
<LI> The directory <I>session-dir</I> must be of type "session".
(That is, its <TT>type</TT> attribute must include this value.)
<LI> Some file or directory in the tree rooted at the working directory 
must have changed since the last <B>vadvance</B>.
</UL>
<DT><A NAME="-F">-F</A> <I>fp-content</I><DD>
Any new or modified files in the directory that are strictly less than
<I>fp-content</I> bytes long are fingerprinted deterministically
according to their contents.  Longer files are fingerprinted with
arbitrary unique identifiers.  The cost of fingerprinting a file's
contents is non-trivial, but doing so allows for cache hits in cases
where two evaluations depend on files that have identical contents but
were inserted into the repository separately.  The default value for
this parameter is determined by the Vesta configuration file; 
<A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration">see below</A>.
The special value -1 causes all files to be fingerprinted by
contents, while 0 causes all files to be fingerprinted by unique
identifier.
<DT><A NAME="-j">-j</A> <I>junk</I><DD>
A space-separated list of <B>glob</B>(3) patterns used to delete
unwanted files from the working directory tree before advancing.
If the last arc of a file's name matches one of the patterns in
<I>junk</I>, and the file was created or modified since the last advance,
the file is deleted.
The default value is obtained from the
Vesta configuration file; <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration">see below</A>.
<DT><A NAME="-J">-J</A><DD>
Clears the <I>junk</I> pattern list; equivalent to <TT>-j ""</TT>.
<DT><A NAME="-z">-z</A> <I>maxsize</I><DD>
Size of the largest new file that <B>vadvance</B> will advance into the
repository, in bytes.  <I>maxsize</I> can be specified with a unit
multiplier:
<UL>
<LI> <B>K</B> = 2^10
<LI> <B>M</B> = 2^20
<LI> <B>G</B> = 2^30
<LI> <B>T</B> = 2^40
</UL>
If a file larger than <I>maxsize</I> was created or modified since
the last advance, the new advance will fail with an error message.
The default value is obtained from the
Vesta configuration file; <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration">see below</A>.
<DT><A NAME="-Z">-Z</A><DD>
Disables the file size limit; equivalent to <TT>-z -1</TT>.
<DT><A NAME="-R">-R</A> <I>repos</I><DD>
Advance the package in <I>repos</I> instead of the default local
repository.  The repository is
specified by host name and TCP port number 
in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it
defaults to <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-v">-v</A><DD>
Displays extra information about <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Triggers">triggers</A>.  Before
executing any trigger commands, the environment variables used to
provide information to them are printed.  Also, each trigger setting
is printed before the command is executed.  This can be used to help
debug trigger problems.  When used with <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-Q">the query flag
(-Q)</A>, the triggers are displayed in their sorted order without
actually running them.

<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[UserInterface]</TT>
section of <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html">the Vesta configuration file
(vesta.cfg)</A>.<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>AppendableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the global root directory of
Vesta repositories is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta</TT>.
<DT><I>MutableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the local tree of mutable directories provided
by Vesta is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta-work</TT>.
<DT><I>DefaultPackageParent</I><DD>
The default directory to put new packages in.  Ordinarily a
subdirectory of the appendable root, named with an Internet domain name
belonging to the local site.
<DT><I>DefaultWorkParent</I><DD>
The default parent directory for mutable working directory trees belonging to
individual users.  Ordinarily the same as the mutable root.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending
<TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the local name.
<DT><I>TimeFormat</I><DD>
A format string for <B>strftime</B>(3) to produce time strings for Vesta
attributes.  A common setting is "%a %b %e %T %Z %Y".
<DT><I>FpContent</I><DD>
The default value for the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-F">-F</A> flag.
<DT><I>vadvance_junk</I><DD>
The default value for the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-j">-j</A> flag.  If not set,
the default is "<TT>*~ .*~ core</TT>".
<DT><I>vadvance_maxsize</I><DD>
The default value for the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-z">-z</A> flag.  If not set,
the default is 1048576 (1 megabyte).
</DL>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[Repository]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file.
<DL>
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_host</I><DD>
The host name of the default (local) repository.
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_port</I><DD>
The default TCP port number for repositories.
</DL>
<P>

Settings in the <TT>[vadvance pre trigger]</TT> and <TT>[vadvance post
trigger]</TT> sections of the configuration file are used as commands to
be run before and after the repository is modified.  See
<A HREF="vadvance.1.html#Triggers">the next section</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Triggers">Triggers</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Users can configure commands in <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html">the Vesta
configuration file (vesta.cfg)</A> to be executed before and after
<B>vadvance</B> modifies the repository.  Each setting in the
<TT>[vadvance pre trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run
before any action is taken, and each setting in the <TT>[vadvance post
trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run after all actions are
complete.<P>

The value of each setting specifies a command to run.  The names of
the settings define the order in which these commands are run.  The
setting names are sorted as strings, but comparing embedded sequences
of digits as decimal integers.  (So, for example "foo_10_bar" will
sort after "foo_2_bar".)  The suggested naming convention for trigger
settings is to start with an integer, follow with a descriptive name,
and follow that with any other text.  (This is based on the convention
used for System V style init script links typically stored in
<TT>/etc/rc<I><B>N</B></I>.d</TT>.)<P>

Here's a simple example of how we suggest naming trigger settings, and
how they are ordered for execution:
<PRE>
[vadvance pre trigger]
100world = echo World!
9tada    = echo Tada:
50hello  = echo Hello,
</PRE>

Because these all start with numbers, they will be executed in the
order "9tada", "50hello", "100world".  The output will look like this:
<PRE>
% vadvance
Tada:
Hello,
World!
Advancing to /vesta/...
</PRE>

Trigger commands are executed with <TT>system</TT>(3).  On most operating
systems this means "<TT>/bin/sh -c <I>command</I></TT>", so simple in-line
shell scripts can be used.  (Note that each is executed in its own
shell process, so environment variables set during one trigger command
<I>will not propagate to subsequent ones</I>.)<P>

If any of the commands in the <TT>[vadvance pre trigger]</TT> section exit
with error (non-zero) status or are terminated by a signal
(e.g. segmentation fault, abort), <B>vadvance</B> will exit without
taking a new snapshot or deleting junk files from the working
directory.<P>

The commands in the <TT>[vadvance post trigger]</TT> section will only be
executed if a new snapshot is taken.  If the working directory hasn't
been modified since the last snapshot or <B>vadvance</B> fails with an
error, the commands in the <TT>[vadvance post trigger]</TT> section
<I>will not be executed</I>.<P>

Note that all the trigger commands (both pre and post) are executed
sequentially.  Once a trigger command is started, nothing else happens
until it completes.  If any of the pre trigger commands runs forever,
<B>vadvance</B> will not take a new snapshot.  If any of the post
trigger commands runs forever, <B>vadvance</B> will not complete.  (In
other words, <I>a trigger command that hangs will cause <B>vadvance</B>
to hang</I>.)  If any of the pre or post trigger commands exit with error
status or are terminated by a signal, <B>vadvance</B> will exit without
running any more commands from those sections.  (In other words, <I>a
trigger command that fails will prevent further trigger commands from
being run</I>.)<P>

If the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> is given (or <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-t">the
test flag (-t)</A>, which implies query), the trigger commands will not
actually be run.<P>

Information about what <B>vadvance</B> is going to do or has just done
is provided to the trigger commands through the following environment
variables:<P>

<DL>

<DT>VESTA_TOOL<DD>
The name of the Vesta tool the trigger command has been invoked from.
(For <B>vadvance</B>, this will always be "vadvance".)
<DT>VESTA_REPOS<DD>
The repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) <B>vadvance</B> communicates
with (either the default from the configuration file or the one
specified with the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-R">-R flag</A>.
<DT>VESTA_WORK_DIR<DD>
The working directory of which a new snapshot is taken.
<DT>VESTA_SESSION_DIR<DD>
The session directory within which the new snapshot version is
created.
<DT>VESTA_SESSION_VER_ARC<DD>
The name of the new snapshot version created by <B>vadvance</B> inside
the session directory.
<DT>VESTA_SESSION_VER<DD>
The full path of the new snapshot version created by <B>vadvance</B>.
(This is the same as "$VESTA_SESSION_DIR/$VESTA_SESSION_VER_ARC".)
<DT>VESTA_PREV_SESSION_VER_ARC<DD>
The name of the highest version existing in the session directory when
<B>vadvance</B> started.
<DT>VESTA_PREV_SESSION_VER<DD>
The full path of the highest version existing in the session directory
when <B>vadvance</B> started.  (This is the same as
"$VESTA_SESSION_DIR/$VESTA_PREV_SESSION_VER_ARC".)
<DT>VESTA_JUNK<DD>
The pattern of "junk files" removed before taking the snapshot.  Set
to the empty string if removal of junk files is disabled with
<A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-J">the -J flag</A>.
<DT>VESTA_MAXSIZE<DD>
The maximum size of file allowed in the snapshot.
<DT>VESTA_FP_CONTENT<DD>
The maximum size of file deterministically fingerprinted by content.
(If set to -1, then all files will be fingerprinted by content,
regardless of size.)
<DT>VESTA_QUIET<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-q">the quiet flag (-q) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
<DT>VESTA_FORCE<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-f">the force flag (-f) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
</DL>
<P>

(Note that the environment variables are the same for both the pre and
post trigger commands.)<P>

Here are some examples using these environment variables:
<PRE>
[vadvance pre trigger]
50print_change = diff -r -u $VESTA_SESSION_VER $VESTA_WORK_DIR | more

[vadvance post trigger]
50stamp_wd = vattrib -R $VESTA_REPOS_HOST:$VESTA_REPOS_PORT -s "last-advanced-at" "`date`" $VESTA_WORK_DIR
</PRE>

If the <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag (-v)</A> is given, these
environment variables will be printed, and each trigger command will
be printed before executing it.  This can be useful for debugging
trigger problems.  If both <A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag</A> and the
<A HREF="vadvance.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> are given, the triggers are displayed
in their sorted order without actually running them.  This can be used
to find out what trigger commands are configured without actually
running them.
