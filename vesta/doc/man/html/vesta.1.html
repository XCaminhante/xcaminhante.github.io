<B>vesta</B> is the Vesta evaluator. It evaluates the model in
<I>modelfile</I>. If no <I>modelfile</I> is specified, a default filename
is taken from the <A HREF="vesta.1.html#configuration">Vesta configuration
file</A>. If <I>modelfile</I> names a directory, the evaluator appends the
default filename.  The <TT>.ves</TT> extension can be omitted in
<I>modelfile</I>.<P>

See the <A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page's
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section for
definitions of terms, and its
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A>
section for an explanation of how model names given on the command
line are looked up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="options">Options</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All options marked with <I>*toggleable*</I> have both a positive and a
negative form.  The negative form is the positive form with "no-"
prepended to it.  A few examples: -k/-no-k, -CLEAN/-no-CLEAN<P>

<B><A NAME="shipping-options">Shipping Options</A></B><P>

The following options can be used to ship derived files to a regular
file system. By default, no derived files are shipped.<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-shipto">-shipto</A> <I>pathname</I><DD>
Ship the evaluation result to the directory specified by <I>pathname</I>,
appending a log of the items shipped to the file <I>pathname</I><TT>/.log</TT>.
The <I>-shipto</I> flag must be specified if any of the <I>-shipfrom</I>,
<I>-s</I>, <I>-clean</I>, and/or <I>-CLEAN</I> flags are present.<P>

The specified <I>pathname</I> may be a file (rather than a directory) if
the <I>-shipfrom</I> flag is given and specifies exactly one value of
type text.  In this case the specified value is shipped to the given
file, and the <TT>.log</TT> file is not written.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-shipfrom">-shipfrom</A> <I>pathname</I><DD>
Specify the component in the evaluation result to be shipped. By
default, the complete evaluation result is shipped to the directory
specified by the <I>-shipto</I> switch.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-s">-s</A>				<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Ship the evaluation result by symbolic links. By default,
the evaluation result is shipped by copying.  Note: these symbolic links 
point to derived files that are not protected from deletion by VestaWeed.
Use this form of shipping with caution.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-clean">-clean</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Remove the old contents of the "shipto" directory (including
subdirectories and the <TT>.log</TT> file) before shipping into it.  If the
directory is nonempty, it must contain a <TT>.log</TT> file; this feature
is meant to protect against inadvertently cleaning out the wrong
directory in the event of a typo.  If this flag is not given, the
shipped value is merged with the existing contents of the "shipto"
directory.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-CLEAN">-CLEAN</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Same as <I>-clean</I>, except that the directory is always cleaned,
regardless of whether a <TT>.log</TT> file exists in it.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-hushship">-hushship</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Only prints that the evaulator has started and finished shipping
instead of printing that it's shipping each file.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-log">-log</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Place a .log file in every directory that's shipped that records
the shortid shipped to each file name.  This defaults to on.
</DL>
<P>

<B><A NAME="eval-options">Evaluation Options</A></B><P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-result">-result</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print out the result of the evaluation.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-maxthreads">-maxthreads</A> <I>n</I><DD>
Set the maximum number of threads that can be run in parallel by 
all invocations of the <TT>_par_map</TT> primitive to <I>n</I>.
Roughly speaking, this is the number of tool
invocations (e.g., compilations) that can be run in parallel.
The default is set in the Vesta configuration file; see below.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-k">-k</A>				<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
When specified, keep evaluating even when the tool fails in a
primitive run_tool call. Any other kind of run-time error (such as
selecting a non-existent field of a binding) is considered fatal,
and terminates the evaluation.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-parse">-parse</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Parse the model only; do not evaluate the model.  Yes, the negative
version does both parse and execute in spite of being -no-parse.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-version">-version</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print the evaluator's version number.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-mstats">-mstats</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print memory statistics after the evaluation (but before shipping).
Sample output:
<PRE>
Memory Stats:
  Total Memory Size        :  86M   (89735168)
  Resident Size            :  39M   (41304064)
  GC Heap Size             :  34M   (36044800)
  GC Total Allocated Bytes : 2.0G (2163721448)
  Garbage Collection Count :  244
</PRE>

"Total Memory Size" is the total virtual memory size of the evaluator
process and "Resident Size" is the portion in physical memory as
reported by the operating system.  The evaluator uses a library for
dynamic memory allocations that supports garbage collection.  "GC Heap
Size" is the portion of the processes memory which is used for dynamic
memory needs (some of which may be free space at the time the
statistics are printed).  "GC Total Allocated Bytes" is the total
number of bytes allocated dynamically since the evaluator started
(including those reclaimed by garbage collection).  "Garbage
Collection Count" is the number of times that a garbage collection has
been performed.  The numbers in parentheses are raw byte totals.<P>

</DL>
<P>

<B><A NAME="debug-options">Debugging Options</A></B><P>

The following options cause the evaluator to print various sorts of
debugging information.<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-stack">-stack</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print the function call stack when a runtime error occurs.  This is
useful for debugging Vesta evaluation errors.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-trace">-trace</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Turn on trace mode.  At the end of the evaluation, print the function
call graph for the current evaluation, including the cache hit/miss
status of each function call, to standard output.  (Note: the call
graph below below any cache hits will not be included.)  This is
useful for debugging the caching behavior of Vesta builds.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-fsdeps">-fsdeps</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print file system dependencies to the standard error output. Whenever
an external tool touches a file in the file system, the name of that
file is printed. This is useful for debugging the case when an
external tool fails because the environment in which it was run does
not contain enough files.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-evalcalls">-evalcalls</A>		<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print to the standard error output all requests made by the repository
in response to file system references by an external tool. The output
generated by this switch is a superset of that generated by the
<I>-fsdeps</I> switch.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-ps">-ps</A>				<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print the current evaluator process status right before it exits.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-dependency-check">-dependency-check</A> <I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Compare the dependencies detected dynamically to those recorded in the
Vesta cache.  When a function call results in a cache hit, the same
function is re-evaluated.  The dependencies are then compared,
printing any differences.  This option is most useful to someone
modifying the evaluator, though it may also be useful to bridge
writers as it can demonstrate subtle tool issues (e.g. recording
dependencies on random temp file names).<P>

<DT><A NAME="-printtimings">-printtimings</A> <I>level</I><DD>
Reports on the wall clock time required to perform certain
operations during the build.
<UL>
<LI> <I>none</I> is silent
<LI> <I>tool</I> reports on the time taken by running of each tool
<LI> <I>func</I> reports on the time taken for user-defined SDL functions
<LI> <I>detail</I> reports the duration of various portions of bookkeeping performed in function calls and around tool runs.  It is not yet implemented.
</UL>
Each level includes all lower levels.  The default level is <I>none</I>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-timingfile">-timingfile</A> <I>filename</I><DD>
Sends the timing report generated by -printtimings to the file <I>filename</I>.
If this option is not specified, stdout is used.  If <I>filename</I>
already exists, it will be overwritten.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-timing-regexp">-timing-regexp</A> <I>regexp</I><DD>
Specifies that timing information should only be recorded for calls
that match a specified regular expression.  This option can be repeated
to supply multiple regular expressions.  The string that is matched against
depends on the type of call:
<UL>
<LI> A user-defined function is formatted as "<TT>&lt;immutable path&gt;/&lt;function name&gt;(), line &lt;line no.&gt;, col &lt;char no.&gt;</TT>".
<LI> A model is formatted as "<TT>&lt;immutable path&gt;() (normal)</TT>"
<LI> A tool is formatted as "<TT>&lt;thread no.&gt;/&lt;run tool hostname&gt;: &lt;command line&gt; </TT>"
</UL>
<P>

<DT><A NAME="-timing-regexp-file">-timing-regexp-file</A><DD> <I>filename</I>
Specifies a file containing one regular expression per line (similar
to grep(1)'s -f option).  Each regular expression is treated as if
specified by <I>-timing-regexp</I>.  Blank lines are ignored.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-timing-args-depth">-timing-args-depth</A><DD> <I>n</I>
In the timing output for function calls, complex nested values of arguments
to the functions are printed to the specified depth.  Simple values are
printed in their entirety.  If this option is not specified, it defaults to 2.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-verbose-dup-msgs">-verbose-dup-msgs</A> <I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Increase the amount of information included in messages about the
supression of duplicate work in parallel.  This provides more
informaion than most users want, but may be helpful when trying to
increase the parallelism of a build.  See
"<A HREF="vesta.1.html#duplicateSuppression">Duplicate Suppression</A>" below for more
information.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-stop-before-tool">-stop-before-tool</A><DD>
Stop execution and print information about where each tool is about to
be run.  The evaluator will stop and wait for the user to press Enter.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-stop-after-tool">-stop-after-tool</A><DD>
Stop execution and print information about where each tool was just
run.  The evaluator will stop and wait for the user to press Enter.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-stop-after-tool-signal">-stop-after-tool-signal</A><DD>
Stop execution and print information about where any tool that was
killed by a signal was just run.  The evaluator will stop and wait
for the user to press Enter.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-stop-after-tool-error">-stop-after-tool-error</A><DD>
Stop execution and print information about where any tool that exited
with non-zero status was just run.  The evaluator will stop and wait
for the user to press Enter.<P>

</DL>
<P>

Using any of the last four options
(<A HREF="vesta.1.html#-stop-before-tool">-stop-before-tool</A>,
<A HREF="vesta.1.html#-stop-after-tool">-stop-after-tool</A>,
<A HREF="vesta.1.html#-stop-after-tool-signal">-stop-after-tool-signal</A>,
<A HREF="vesta.1.html#-stop-after-tool-error">-stop-after-tool-error</A>) gives the user
the opportunity to make changes which may affect the result of a
<TT>_run_tool</TT> call.  For this reason, any <TT>_run_tool</TT> calls
affected by using these options (which in some cases will be all
<TT>_run_tool</TT> calls) are not cached.  Also, anything which uses the
result of an affected <TT>_run_tool</TT> call will not be cached.<P>

<B><A NAME="cache-options">Caching Options</A></B><P>

The following options control caching behavior.<P>

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="-pk-salt">-pk-salt</A> <I>salt</I><DD>
Modify the keys used to store and lookup entries in the Vesta cache by
using the supplied <I>salt</I> string.  The <I>salt</I> argument can be
any string; it is not parsed in any way, but rather is used like a
hash table key.  This feature allows you to simulate having a private
cache that is shared only among those evaluations with the same
<I>salt</I> string.  When using this feature, the evaluator will
<B>not</B> re-use results in the cache created by evaluations with a
different <I>salt</I> string (or that didn't use -pk-salt at all).
("pk" is short for <I>primary key</I>, a term which is explained below
in the <A HREF="vesta.1.html#pragmas">Recognized Pragmas</A> section.)<P>

<DT><A NAME="-cache">-cache</A> <I>level</I><DD>
Specify the caching level.  There are four different caching levels:
<I>none</I> means not to use the Vesta cache; <I>runtool</I> means to
cache runtool calls only; <I>model</I> means to cache runtool and
model calls only; <I>all</I> means to cache all cacheable function
calls.  When the caching level is <I>model</I> or <I>all</I>, precise 
fine grained dependency analysis is enabled.  The default caching
level is <I>all</I>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-noaddentry">-noaddentry</A>		<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Prevent any new cache entry from being added to the cache. This option
is useful when one wants to reproduce repeatedly the same behavior of
an evaluation in the presence of a Vesta cache. Note that this option
is different from "-cache none" because the evaluator can get hits on
existing cache entries when this option is used. This has two negative
versions: -no-noaddentry and -addentry.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-cstats">-cstats</A>			<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
Print cache statistics after the evaluation.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-cdebug">-cdebug</A> <I>level</I><DD>
Print cache debugging information. The relevant options (in increasing
order of verbosity) are: <I>None</I> (the default), <I>AddEntryOp</I>,
<I>OtherOps</I>, and <I>All</I>. See
<A HREF="VCache.1.html#OptionsSect"><B>VCache</B>(1)</A> for more details.
</DL>
<P>

<B><A NAME="repos-options">Repository Options</A></B><P>

The following options control how the evaluator interacts with the
Vesta repository:<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-autorepl">-autorepl</A>		<I>*toggleable*</I><DD>
If any imported packages are missing in the local repository, this
option causes the evaluator to try to automatically locate a copy
in a peer repository and replicate it.  (See
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html">vrepl(1)</A>.)  Defaults to on.  Use
<I>-no-autorepl</I> to disable this feature.  (When disabled, a missing
import is always a fatal error.)
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="pragmas">Recognized Pragmas</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The evaluator recognizes three stylized comments, or <I>pragmas</I>. Two
of them control how it caches calls of user-defined functions.  The
third controls how aggressively it will execute user-defined functions
in parallel.  The three pragmas are <TT>/**nocache**/</TT>, <TT>/**pk**/</TT>,
and <TT>/**waitdup**/</TT>.  We expect that these pragmas will be required
only in bridge models, not typical client models.<P>

When a user-defined function is called, the evaluator first looks to
see if that function has already been evaluated with sufficiently
similar arguments. If so, it gets a hit in the cache and uses the
function result returned by the cache. Otherwise, it evaluates the
called function and adds an entry to the cache for the result.<P>

To do a cache lookup, the evaluator provides a cache key. The cache
key is actually composed of two parts: the run-time values on which
the function result is thought to depend, which together comprise the
<I>primary key</I>, and the run-time values on which the function result
may depend, which together comprise the <I>secondary key</I>.<P>

By default, calls of all user-defined functions are cached.
If the <TT>/**nocache**/</TT> pragma appears immediately before a
function definition, calls of that function are not cached.
The <TT>/**nocache**/</TT> pragma can be used if the work performed by the
function is trivial and if the number of calls made by the function is
known or expected to be small (preferably 0 or 1).<P>

By default, the primary key is a combination of the closure value
(i.e., the function) being called and the values of all actual
arguments that are not composite values (i.e., not of type list,
binding, or closure). If the <TT>/**pk**/</TT> pragma appears immediately
before the name of a function's formal parameter, the value of the
corresponding actual parameter is also folded into the function's
primary key, regardless of whether it is a composite value or not. The
<TT>/**pk**/</TT> pragma can be used to include a composite value into the
function's primary key when the function's result is known to depend
on the <I>entire</I> composite value.<P>

The <A HREF="vesta.1.html#-pk-salt">-pk-salt</A> command line option allows you to
combine an additional arbitrary string into the primary key of every
function call.<P>

By default, when multiple threads are executing the same function
it may be executed multiple times in parallel.  The <TT>/**waitdup**/</TT>
pragma will cause any threads after the first one that are about to
execute a function with the same <I>primary key</I> to wait on the hope
that once the first function adds an entry to the cache the later
threads will hit on that entry.  This pragma is placed similarly to
the <TT>/**nocache**/</TT> one.  It will also control the execution of
models if placed just before the opening brace.  For models, the
<I>primary key</I> is the immutable path to the model file itself.  See
"<A HREF="vesta.1.html#duplicateSuppression">Duplicate Suppression</A>" below for more
information.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="duplicateSuppression">Duplicate Suppression</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Aggressive use of the <TT>_par_map</TT> primitive function can lead to
multiple evaluator threads doing the same work in parallel
(e.g. running the same tool or evaluating the same SDL function).  If
a previous build had completed the same work and added an entry to the
Vesta cache both threads could get a cache hit on that entry.  The
result is wasted effort in duplicate work.<P>

To help you put resources to better use, the evaluator can pause any
threads that try to evaluate a function call that is already being
processed.  These threads will be woken up after the first thread has
finished the call.  Once the first thread adds an entry to the Vesta
cache, any threads that waited will hopefully hit on that entry.<P>

Unfortunately, it's not possible to be certain that two function calls
are identical before evaluating them.  When two function calls have
the same <I>primary key</I>, the evaluator guesses that they may be the
same and makes subsequent threads calling the same function wait.  To
indicate the heuristic nature of this suppression, any thread that
waits will print an informational message that starts with "Waiting on
possibly identical" followed by either "model", "function", or "tool"
depending on the type of evaluation that is waiting.<P>

The <TT>_run_tool</TT> primitive function always waits when another thread
is executing a potential duplicate.  By default, a user-defined
function or model may be executed multiple times in parallel.  The
<TT>/**waitdup**/</TT> pragma will cause user-defined functions and models
to wait when another thread is executing a possible duplicate.  (See
"<A HREF="vesta.1.html#pragmas">Recognized Pragmas</A>" above.)<P>

Here are some examples of the default "Waiting on possibly identical"
informational messages:
<PRE>
3/Waiting on possibly identical tool (6/... /usr/bin/g++-3.4)
5/Waiting on possibly identical function (program)
7/Waiting on possibly identical model
</PRE>

If a thread waited on a possible duplicate but got a subsequent cache
miss, another informational message is printed:
<PRE>
5/Function missed after waiting (program).
</PRE>

This can indicate cases where waiting for possible duplicates isn't
helping.  In some cases, the solution is to include more values in the
<I>primary key</I> (e.g. with the <TT>/**pk**/</TT> pragma).  In others, the
solution may be to remove the <TT>/**waitdup**/</TT> pragma.<P>

If you want to identify more precisely where parallelism is being
limited by waiting, use the
<A HREF="vesta.1.html#-verbose-dup-msgs">-verbose-dup-msgs</A> command-line option.
This increases the amount of information provided about the possible
duplicate.  The above messages might then look like this:
<PRE>
3/Waiting on possibly identical tool (6/... /usr/bin/g++-3.4 -c -pipe -O0 -g2 Version.C)
5/Waiting on possibly identical function (/vesta/vestasys.org/bridges/c_like/9/build.ves/program(), line 812, col 12)
7/Waiting on possibly identical model (/vesta/example.com/foo/bar/checkout/12/34/build.ves)
...
5/Function missed after waiting (/vesta/vestasys.org/bridges/c_like/9/build.ves/program(), line 812, col 12).
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="configuration">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The evaluator reads site-specific configuration information from a Vesta
configuration file named <I>vesta.cfg</I>.<P>

The following values are obtained from the [Evaluator] section of the
Vesta configuration file:<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>DefaultMain</I><DD>
Gives one or more default model names to evaluate if none is
explicitly specified.  Multiple names are given separated by
whitesapce, and are tried in order.  (For example, if set to
"<TT>linux_alpha.main.ves linux_ia32.main.ves .main.ves</TT>", if a model
named "<TT>linux_alpha.main.ves</TT>" exists it will be evaluated, or if
not and a model named "<TT>linux_ia32.main.ves</TT>" exists it will be
evaluated, otherwise if a model named "<TT>.main.ves</TT>" exists it will
be evaluated.)  If not set, "<TT>.main.ves</TT>" is used.<P>

<DT><I>Switches</I><DD>
Specifies evaluator command line switches that will be used on every
run. These switches are overridden by any explicit switches used on
the evaluator command line.<P>

<DT><I>MaxThreads</I><DD>
Gives the default value for the -maxthreads option; see above.<P>

<DT><I>FpContent</I><DD>
Newly created derived files that are strictly less than <I>FpContent</I>
bytes long are fingerprinted deterministically according to their
contents.  Longer files are fingerprinted with arbitrary unique
identifiers.  The cost of fingerprinting a file's contents is
non-trivial, but doing so allows for cache hits in cases where two
evaluations depend on files that have identical contents but were
created in separate evaluations.  The special value -1 causes all
files to be fingerprinted by contents, while 0 causes all files to be
fingerprinted by unique identifier.  (See the documentation for the
<TT>_run_tool</TT> primitive function for more information.)<P>

<DT><I>server_max_threads</I><DD>
A tuning parameter which controls the number of file access callbacks
from the repository simultaneously served during a tool invocation.  A
reasonable value is 4.  There's normally no need to change it. (Note
that there is no built-in default value.)<P>

<DT><I>NegligibleExternalLoadPerCPU</I><DD>
A tuning parameter which controls how hosts are selected for
_run_tool() jobs.  It is a scaling factor that is multiplied by the
number of CPUs in the candidate Run Tool Host.  If the load average is
below the result of this multiplication and the RunToolServer is
running no other jobs, the host is immediately chosen to run the tool
invocation.  (If not, it may still be chosen later if it's the least
loaded candidate host.)  If not set, it defaults to 0.75.<P>

<DT><I>core_dump_regexp</I><DD>
When a tool dies with a core dump, the evaluator searches the
filesystem used for the tool for core dumps.  (It can't know
necessarily where they will be, as the tool could change working
directories.)  The evaluator will print information about any files
with names matching this regular expression written by a tool that
dumped core.  If not set, defaults to "<TT>core(\.[0-9][0-9]*)?</TT>".<P>

<DT><I>WorkerStackSize</I><DD>
Threads created when using <TT>_par_map</TT> have their stack size
determined by this setting. If your SDL models use deep recursion,
you may want to increase it. If not set, defaults to 1048576 (1 MB).<P>

<DT><I>print_numeric_sid</I><DD>
When printing a text value backed by a shortid file (either as part of
the result printed by the <A HREF="vesta.1.html#-result">-result</A> option or the
<TT>_print</TT> primitive function), this setting enables printing the
shortid as a hexadecimal number (in addition to the path normally
printed).  (This is probably only interesting to people actively
developing Vesta.)  This is a boolean configuration setting.  If equal
(without regard to case) to "yes", "on", or "true", or can be parsed
as an integer that is non-zero, the hexadecimal shortid will be
printed.  If equal (without regard to case) to "no", "off", or
"false", or can be parsed as an integer that is zero, the hexadecimal
shortid will <I>not</I> be printed.  If not set, defaults to "false".<P>

<DT><I>PickleParanoia</I><DD>
Can be used to enable paranoid double-checking of data stored into a
serialized (aka "pickled") evaluator value to be added to the Vesta
cache.  Currently only two settings are recognized: 0 (disabled) and 1
(enabled).  (It's disabled by default.)  In the future, other higher
values might be added for greater levels of paranoid checking.  This
should be totally unnecessary as it simply reads back data encoded
into a bytes stream (just integers at level 1).  Unfortunately, we've
observed a few cases where the evaluator seems to have encoded the
wrong integer which causes problems later when another evaluator gets
a cache hit on the bad entry.  (This could happen if you have a large
number of clients and some have flaky hardware.)  Turning this on may
prevent such incorrectly written entries from making it into the
cache.<P>

<DT><I>symlink_sid_root</I><DD>
If set, the value replaces <TT>[Repository]metadata_root</TT> in the
target of symlinks created when shipping with the <A HREF="vesta.1.html#-s">-s</A> flag.
This could be used with an alternative method of distributing build
results to client hosts.  Note that <TT>[Repository]sid_dir</TT> and the
path for the shortid made up of hex digits will be appended to this
when forming the symlink target.  For example, if
<I>symlink_sid_root</I> is set to "<TT>/foo/bar</TT>" and
<TT>[Repository]sid_dir</TT> is set to "<TT>sid</TT>" (as it typically is),
the the link target for shortid 0xa1b2c3d4 would be
"<TT>/foo/bar/sid/a1b/2c3/d4</TT>".<P>

very slow in responding.  Defaults to 120 seconds (2 minutes).  (Note
that this timeout only applies after a connection is established, and
is only provided to guard against misbehaving or overloaded peers.)<P>

<H3><A NAME="runtool">Runtool Host Selection</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

When the <TT>_run_tool</TT> primitive is invoked to run an external tool,
the evaluator must choose a specific host machine to run the tool on.
To do so, it first looks up the <I>platform</I> argument in a
correspondingly named section of the Vesta configuration file,
[<I>platform</I>].  This section describes the platform type by giving a
list of characteristics that a host machine of this type must have,
and it includes a list of candidate hosts to try.  The evaluator
searches the list for a host that matches the description and is not
too heavily loaded.  The following names must be defined in a platform
section:<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>sysname</I><DD>
Specifies the name of the operating system, as returned by the
uname(2) system call in the sysname field.  The given value can be a glob(3)
pattern (a pattern using <TT>*</TT>, <TT>?</TT>, and <TT>[]</TT>
characters as in shell filename 
matching).  Typical values are "OSF1" for Tru64 Unix, or "Linux" for Linux.<P>

<DT><I>release</I><DD>
The release of the operating system, as returned by the uname(2) system
call in the release field.  This value can be a glob(3) pattern.
Typical values are "V[45].0" to match either Tru64 Unix 4.0 or 5.0, or
"2.4.*" to match any 2.4-series Linux kernel.<P>

<DT><I>version</I><DD>
The minor version number of the operating system, as returned by the
uname(2) system call in the version field.  This value can be a
glob(3) pattern.  Typically "*" is used in this field, as the OS minor
version number is not usually significant in choosing a machine 
to run tools on.<P>

<DT><I>machine</I><DD>
The type of processor, as returned by the
uname(2) system call in the version field.  This value can be a
glob(3) pattern.  Typical values are "alpha" to select an Alpha processor,
or "i?86" to select an Intel x86 processor.<P>

<DT><I>cpus</I><DD>
The minimum number of CPUs present.  Use 1 if a uniprocessor is acceptable.<P>

<DT><I>cpuMHz</I><DD>
The minimum CPU clock speed, in megahertz.  Typically set to 0, but
you can specify a larger number if only machines of at least a certain
speed are acceptable.<P>

<DT><I>memKB</I><DD>
The minimum number of kilobytes of physical memory.  Typically set to
0, but you can specify a larger number if only machines with at least a
certain amount of memory are acceptable.<P>

<DT><I>hosts</I><DD> A list of candidate hosts to try, separated by
spaces.  Hosts are specified as either <I>hostname</I>, or
<I>hostname</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.  If the port is not specified, it
defaults to the standard RunToolServer port, given in section
[Run_Tool], value <I>SRPC_port</I>.  There must be a
<A HREF="RunToolServer.1.html">RunToolServer(1)</A> at the given port on
each host; if not, the evaluator prints a warning and drops the host
from the list.  The evaluator also prints a warning if a host on the
list does not match the platform description.<P>

If the first hostname is the string "localhost", the local host will
always be considered first.  If the string "localhost" appears
elsewhere in the list, the local host will be considered but not given
any special preference.  If the string "localhost" does not appear,
the local host will be used only if its name appears explicitly.  If
the same host appears twice (in particular, if it appears both as
"localhost" and under its own name), the duplicates are eliminated.
</DL>
<P>

By convention, the following target platform names are normally used:<P>

<DL>

<DT><I>DU4.0</I><DD> An Alpha machine running version 4.0x of the Digital
Unix (aka Compaq/HP Tru64 Unix) operating system<P>

<DT><I>Linux-alpha</I><DD> An Alpha machine running Linux<P>

<DT><I>Linux-i386</I><DD> An Intel 386 or higher running Linux<P>

<DT><I>Linux-i686</I><DD> An Intel 686 or higher running Linux<P>

<DT><I>Linux-ppc</I><DD> A PowerPC running Linux<P>

<DT><I>Linux-sparc</I><DD> A Sparc running Linux<P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="ToolCore">Tools That Dump Core</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The evaluator provides a little extra help if a tool's exit status
indicates that it produced a core dump.  If this happens, the
evaluator will search the filesystem used for the tool for any core
dumps.  (It can't know necessarily where they will be, as the tool
could change working directories.)  For any files with names matching
the regular expression specified with the
<TT>[Evaluator]core_dump_regexp</TT> <A HREF="vesta.1.html#configuration">configuration
variable</A>, the evaluator will print a message like this:
<PRE>
3/Possible core file: /.WD/core.1234
3/at /vesta-srv/sid/abc/def/12
</PRE>

The path on the first line is the location where the core file was
written during the tool execution.  (This is mostly for informational
purposes, as the temporary filesystem for the tool invocation will be
deleted shortly after this message is printed.)  The path after "at"
is the location where the written core file can be accessed directly
from the repository's storage area.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="EnvVars">Environment Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

If set, the <TT>DEBUG_TOOL_DIR_SERVER</TT> environment variable can be
used for debugging purposes.  It causes the evalutor to display extra
information that can be helpful in intercepting and understanding the
traffic between the evaluator and the repository.  There are two kinds
of information printed when this environment variable is set:<P>

<UL>

<LI> Just before it begins listening for connections from the
repository, the evaluator prints the port it is listening on and waits
for the user to press enter:
<PRE>
Tool directory server listening on port 3341
Hit enter to continue: 
</PRE>

This makes it possible for a network capture tool (e.g. <TT>tcpdump</TT>)
to be started to capture the traffic to and from the evaluator's tool
directory server interface.<P>

<LI> When each tool invocation begins, it prints three pieces of
information about its temporary root filesystem: the 64-bit handle
that the repository uses to request information from the evaluator
about the root for the tool, the LongId assigned to it by the
repository, and the name of the directory below the volatile root.
These are printed right after the command line of the tool and are
prefixed with the same thread marker:
<PRE>
3/[tool dir server root handle = 122cad0000200002]
3/[root LongId = 0002fca00b]
3/[root directory name = 0002d07c]
</PRE>

This information makes it possible to correspond NFS transactions and
tool directory server transactions with a tool invocation.<P>

</UL>
