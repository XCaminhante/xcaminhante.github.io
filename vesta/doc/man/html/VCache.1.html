<I>VCache</I> is the Vesta-2 function cache server process. It keeps a
persistent record of Vesta-2 function evaluations. The primary client
of the function cache is the Vesta-2 evaluator vesta(1), which evaluates
Vesta build descriptions, also known as models.<P>

The function cache expects certain directories to exist, and creates
files in those directories. To create the necessary directories, use
the <A HREF="CreateCacheDirs.1.html">CreateCacheDirs(1)</A> program. For
information about the files written by <I>VCache</I>, see the
<A HREF="VCache.1.html#ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A> and
<A HREF="VCache.1.html#FilesSect">Files</A> sections below.

<P>

The function cache recognizes the following command-line options:<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="DebugOption"><B>-debug</B> <I>level</I></A><DD>
By default, no debugging information is printed. However, the cache
server has support for printing various kinds of debugging
information. This debugging output is catagorized into various levels.
All levels at and below the specified <I>level</I> will be printed. The
possible values for <I>level</I> (in increasing order) are:<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>None</I><DD>
Don't print any debugging information. This is the default.<P>

<DT><I>StatusMsgs</I><DD>
Print function cache status messages, such as a message when the cache
server starts up and messages when clients disconnect. The startup
message includes the name of the <A HREF="VCache.1.html#ConfigSect">configuration
file</A>, the selected debugging levels, and the value for the
<A HREF="VCache.1.html#MaxRunning"><I>MaxRunning</I></A> configuration variable.<P>

<DT><I>LeaseExp</I><DD>
Print a message when leases on cache entries expire. The duration of
cache entry leases is controlled by the
<A HREF="VCache.1.html#LeaseTimeoutHrs"><I>LeaseTimeoutHrs</I></A> configuration variable
(described below). Cache entry leases are implemented as a pair of bit
vectors, <I>new</I> and <I>old</I>. When a new lease is taken out on a
cache entry, the corresponding bit is set in the <I>new</I> vector. A
lease exists for a cache entry if its bit is set in either vector. To
expire leases, a background thread repeatedly copies <I>new</I> to
<I>old</I> and zeros out <I>new</I>. The lease debugging output shows a
prefix of both vectors before they are expired. The bit vectors are
printed in hex, a byte at a time, least significant byte first. When
the vector is longer than 256 bits, the output is elided with
ellipses.<P>

<DT><I>LogRecover</I><DD>
Print a description of data recovered from the function cache's logs at
start-up.<P>

<DT><I>LogFlush</I><DD>
Print a message each time the flush of a function cache log is started
or finished. The logs are typically flushed whenever a client
invokes the function cache's <I>Checkpoint</I> method. At this
debugging level, the values flushed to the logs are not printed;
use the <I>LogFlushEntries</I> level below for that.<P>

<DT><I>MPKFileFlush</I><DD>
Print messages when volatile cache entries are flushed to the stable
cache (namely, to stable MultiPKFiles).<P>

<DT><I>LogFlushEntries</I><DD>
Print (possibly elided versions of) the values written to the function
cache's logs when they are flushed. The output in this case may be
interspersed with other debugging output, but whole lines are
guaranteed to be printed atomically.<P>

<DT><I>WeederOps</I><DD>
Print the arguments and results of all weeder calls  to the cache
server.<P>

<DT><I>AddEntryOp</I><DD>
Print the arguments and results of <I>AddEntry</I> calls to the cache
server.<P>

<DT><I>OtherOps</I><DD>
Print the arguments and results of all other calls to the cache
server, including <I>FreeVariables</I>, <I>Lookup</I>, and
<I>Checkpoint</I>.<P>

<DT><I>All</I><DD>
Print all debugging information. This is equivalent to <I>OtherOps</I>.
</DL>
<P>

Debugging output is grouped into logical <I>entries</I>. Each debugging
output entry includes a timestamp, and debugging output is
synchronized so that entries produced by different threads are not
interleaved.<P>

<DT><A NAME="NoHitsOption"><B>-noHits</B></A><DD>
If <B>-noHits</B> is specified, the lookup operation on the cache
will never produce a hit. This is useful for debugging clients of the
function cache.
</DL>
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, the function cache reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. The function cache first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The variables used by the
function cache are in the section denoted by <TT>[CacheServer]</TT>. Here
are the variables and their meanings; the types of the variables are
shown in parentheses. Those variables corresponding to paths or
directories should <I>not</I> end with a slash ("/") character.<P>

The following variables are the function cache's operating
parameters:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>Port</TT> (integer)<DD>
The port number on which the server listens for connections.<P>

<DT><TT>Host</TT> (hostname)<DD>
The host on which the cache server runs.  Used by clients to connect
to the cache server.<P>

<DT><A NAME="MaxRunning"><TT>MaxRunning</TT> (integer) (optional)</A><DD>
The maximum number of client requests that the function cache will
handle at any given time. If this many requests are currently running
and another is received, it will block. Defaults to 32.<P>

<DT><TT>MaxCacheLogCnt</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Controls the frequency of attempts to clean the cache log. Whenever
the cache log is flushed and the number of cache entries written to
the cache log since it was last cleaned exceeds this value, the
background cache log cleaner thread is signaled to clean the cache
log. Defaults to 500 entries.<P>

<DT><TT>MPKFileFlushNum</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Whenever a new cache entry is added to a MultiPKFile and the total
number of new cache entries in that MultiPKFile exceeds this value,
the MultiPKFile is flushed to disk by a background MultiPKFile flusher
thread. Defaults to 20.<P>

<DT><A NAME="LeaseTimeoutHrs"><TT>LeaseTimeoutHrs</TT> (integer)</A><DD>
A lower-bound (in hours) on the duration of cache entry leases.<P>

<DT><TT>FlushWorkerCnt</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Controls the number of background threads initially allocated for
flushing MultiPKFiles to disk. Certain cache activities, like the
background MultiPKFile freeing thread (described below), and
invocations of the <TT>CacheS::FlushAll</TT> method, block unless an idle
worker thread is available. Hence, this variable controls how many
MultiPKFiles the cache may be flushing concurrently as the result of
certain operations. Defaults to 5.<P>

<DT><TT>FreePauseDur</TT> (integer)<DD>
The number of seconds that the background MultiPKFile/PKFile
freeing/flushing thread sleeps between attempts to flush new cache
entries to disk and free memory.  When the MultiPKFile freeing thread
wakes up, it attempts to flush new entries in MultiPKFiles that have
not been recently accessed, thereby freeing memory consumed by those
cache entries.  It also frees memory by purging "warm" entries paged
in from disk and freeing datat structures for PKFiles and MultiPKFiles
that haven't been used recently.  See the related
<TT>FlushNewPeriodCnt</TT>, <TT>PurgeWarmPeriodCnt</TT>, <TT>EvictPeriodCnt</TT>,
and <TT>FreeAggressively</TT> variables below.<P>

<DT><TT>FlushNewPeriodCnt</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Each time the background freeing/flushing thread wakes up to do work,
it increments an epoch. An MPKFile is considered "stale" (and hence,
in need of being flushed), if it has not been had any entries added
within <TT>FlushNewPeriodCnt</TT> epochs. Defaults to 1.  (If this
variable is not set and the older name <TT>FreePeriodCnt</TT> is set, it
will be used, for backward compatibility.)<P>

<DT><TT>PurgeWarmPeriodCnt</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Each time the background freeing/flushing thread wakes up to do work,
it increments an epoch. A PKFile with no new entries waiting to be
flushed to disk will have its "warm" entries (those paged in from
disk) freed from memory if it hasn't been used by any client calls
(FreeVariables, Lookup, AddEntry) in <TT>PurgeWarmPeriodCnt</TT> epochs.
Defaults to <TT>FlushNewPeriodCnt</TT> plus 1.<P>

<DT><TT>EvictPeriodCnt</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Each time the background freeing/flushing thread wakes up to do work,
it increments an epoch. A PKFile with no new entries waiting to be
flushed to disk and no "warm" entries paged in from disk will have
its data structures removed from the cache (to free memory) if it
hasn't been used by any client calls (FreeVariables, Lookup, AddEntry)
in <TT>EvictPeriodCnt</TT> epochs.  Defaults to <TT>PurgeWarmPeriodCnt</TT>
plus 1.<P>

<DT><TT>FreeAggressively</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
By default, when the background MultiPKFile freeing thread wakes up, it
increments the flush epoch, but goes back to sleep if there has been
any activity on the cache since the thread originally went to sleep.
If this variable is non-zero, the thread will attempt to flush stale
MultiPKFiles even if there has been some load on the cache. Defaults
to 0 (false).<P>

<DT><TT>KeepNewOnFlush</TT>, <TT>KeepOldOnFlush</TT> (integers) (optional)<DD>
These values control the policy that determines which cache entries
are kept in memory when a PKFile is flushed (updated). The first
controls what happens to new entries that are not yet saved on disk,
and the second controls what happens to "old" entries that have been
paged-in from disk. If non-zero, the entries are kept in memory; if
zero, they are dropped for the garbage collector to reclaim. Both
default to 0 (false).
</DL>
<P>

Here are the function cache's file system variables:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
Other configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.
The directories (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which
the function cache stores its cache log, graph log, cache index (CI),
and weeded MPKFile logs, respectively.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>SCacheDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which the
function cache stores cache entries.<P>

<DT><TT>CacheLogDir</TT>, <TT>EmptyPKLogDir</TT>, <TT>GraphLogDir</TT>, <TT>CILogDir</TT>, <TT>WeededLogDir</TT> (strings)<DD>
The directories (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which
the function cache stores its cache log, empty PKFile log, graph log,
cache index (CI) log, and weeded MPKFile log, respectively.<P>

<DT><TT>StableVarsDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which the
function cache stores files corresponding to its stable variables.<P>

<DT><TT>Deleting</TT>, <TT>HitFilter</TT>, <TT>MPKsToWeed</TT> (strings)<DD>
The files (relative to MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir/StableVarsDir)
corresponding to stable function cache variables.
</DL>
<P>

The following configuration variables are for debugging purposes only:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>LeaseTimeoutSpeedup</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
The factor by which the <TT>LeaseTimeoutHrs</TT> should be reduced. For
example, if <TT>LeaseTimeoutHrs</TT> is 1 and <TT>LeaseTimeoutSpeedup</TT> is
120, then the cache entry leases will time out every 30 seconds.
Defaults to 1.<P>

<DT><TT>WeedPauseDur</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
The number of seconds that a thread flushing a MultiPKFile pauses
after updating cache entries in memory but before it begins atomically
replacing volatile PKFiles and commiting the new stable MultiPKFile.
Defaults to 0.<P>

<DT><TT>ReadImmutable</TT> (integer) (optional)<DD>
Controls whether the immutable parts of cache entries are read into
memory when a MultiPKFile is flushed. If non-zero, the immutable
fields are read into memory. If zero, the immutable parts of a cache
entry are copied from the original MultiPKFile to the new one. 
Defaults to 0 (false).

<P>

The function cache crashes occasionally due to a memory smash we
have not tracked down. A common symptom of the crash is the following
assertion failure:
<PRE>
Assertion failed: logNode-&gt;kind == GraphLog::NodeKind, file CacheS.C, line 2003
</PRE>

However, the bug is not terribly serious because the function cache
recovers just fine when it is restarted.<P>

See the <A HREF="VCacheToDo.7.html">VCacheToDo(7)</A> man page for
a complete list of things that remain to be done to complete the cache
server implementation.
