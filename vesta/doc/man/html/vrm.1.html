See the <A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page's
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section for
definitions of terms, and its
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A>
section for an explanation of how names are looked up.<P>

The <B>vrm</B> command removes one or more files or directories from the
Vesta repository.  Removing an object from an appendable directory
leaves a ghost behind.  If the object to be removed is a directory, it
need not be empty.<P>

This command provides an alternative to removing an object with the
normal <B>rm</B> or <B>rmdir</B> commands through the repository's NFS
interface.  It is needed in cases where your NFS client thinks you
don't have permission to remove because it doesn't fully understand
Vesta access controls.  The <B>vrm</B> command also makes it possible to
remove an object from a remote repository that you do not have NFS
mounted.<P>

You must have write access to the directory from which <I>name</I> is to
be removed.<P>

<B>vrm</B> returns status 0 for success, 1 for parameter syntax
errors, or 2 for more serious errors.  (Note that if any of the
<A HREF="vrm.1.html#Triggers">trigger commands</A> fail, <B>vrm</B> returns status 2.)

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-q">-q</A><DD>
Quiet; suppress printing out what is being done.
<DT><A NAME="-Q">-Q</A><DD>
Query; print out what the command would do, but don't do it.
<DT><A NAME="-R">-R</A> <I>repos</I><DD>
Remove the object from <I>repos</I> instead of the default local
repository.  The repository is
specified by host name and TCP port number 
in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it
defaults to <A HREF="vrm.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-v">-v</A><DD>
Displays extra information about <A HREF="vrm.1.html#Triggers">triggers</A>.  Before
executing any trigger commands, the environment variables used to
provide information to them are printed.  Also, each trigger setting
is printed before the command is executed.  This can be used to help
debug trigger problems.  When used with <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-Q">the query flag
(-Q)</A>, the triggers are displayed in their sorted order without
actually running them.

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[UserInterface]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file (vesta.cfg).<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>AppendableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the global root directory of
Vesta repositories is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta</TT>.
<DT><I>MutableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the local tree of mutable directories provided
by Vesta is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta-work</TT>.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is optional.  If it is not set,
<TT>[Repository]realm</TT> is used.
</DL>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[Repository]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file.
<DL>
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_host</I><DD>
The host name of the default (local) repository.
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_port</I><DD>
The default TCP port number for repositories.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is only used if <TT>[UserInterface]realm</TT> is
not set.
</DL>
<P>

Settings in the <TT>[vrm pre trigger]</TT> and <TT>[vrm post trigger]</TT>
sections of the configuration file are used as commands to be run
before and after the repository is modified.  See <A HREF="vrm.1.html#Triggers">the
next section</A>.

<P>

Users can configure commands in <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html">the Vesta
configuration file (vesta.cfg)</A> to be executed before and after
<B>vrm</B> modifies the repository.  Each setting in the <TT>[vrm pre
trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run before any action is
taken, and each setting in the <TT>[vrm post trigger]</TT> section
specifies a command to be run after all actions are complete.<P>

The value of each setting specifies a command to run.  The names of
the settings define the order in which these commands are run.  The
setting names are sorted as strings, but comparing embedded sequences
of digits as decimal integers.  (So, for example "foo_10_bar" will
sort after "foo_2_bar".)  The suggested naming convention for trigger
settings is to start with an integer, follow with a descriptive name,
and follow that with any other text.  (This is based on the convention
used for System V style init script links typically stored in
<TT>/etc/rc<I><B>N</B></I>.d</TT>.)<P>

Here's a simple example of how we suggest naming trigger settings, and
how they are ordered for execution:
<PRE>
[vrm pre trigger]
100world = echo World!
9tada    = echo Tada:
50hello  = echo Hello,
</PRE>

Because these all start with numbers, they will be executed in the
order "9tada", "50hello", "100world".  The output will look like this:
<PRE>
% vrm /vesta/example.com/...
Tada:
Hello,
World!
Deleting /vesta/example.com/...
</PRE>

Trigger commands are executed with <TT>system</TT>(3).  On most operating
systems this means "<TT>/bin/sh -c <I>command</I></TT>", so simple in-line
shell scripts can be used.  (Note that each is executed in its own
shell process, so environment variables set during one trigger command
<I>will not propagate to subsequent ones</I>.)<P>

If any of the commands in the <TT>[vrm pre trigger]</TT> section exit with
error (non-zero) status or are terminated by a signal
(e.g. segmentation fault, abort), <B>vrm</B> will exit without deleting.<P>

The commands in the <TT>[vrm post trigger]</TT> section will only be
executed if the deletion is successfully performed.  If <B>vrm</B> fails
with an error, the commands in the <TT>[vrm post trigger]</TT> section
<I>will not be executed</I>.<P>

Note that all the trigger commands (both pre and post) are executed
sequentially.  Once a trigger command is started, nothing else happens
until it completes.  If any of the pre trigger commands runs forever,
<B>vrm</B> will not perform a deletion.  If any of the post trigger
commands runs forever, <B>vrm</B> will not complete.  (In other words,
<I>a trigger command that hangs will cause <B>vrm</B> to hang</I>.)  If
any of the pre or post trigger commands exit with error status or are
terminated by a signal, <B>vrm</B> will exit without running any more
commands from those sections.  (In other words, <I>a trigger command
that fails will prevent further trigger commands from being run</I>.)<P>

If a single <B>vrm</B> command is given more than one file or directory
to delete, the pre and post trigger commands will be run once for each
object being deleted.  The pre trigger commands command are run just
before deleting each object and after deleting any preceding objects,
and the post trigger commands are just after deleting each object and
before deleting any following objects.  If any of the trigger commands
(either pre or post) exit with error status or are terminated by a
signal, <B>vrm</B> will stop processing immediately, <I>even if there
are additional objects to be deleted</I>.  (In other words, <I>a trigger
command that fails may prevent objects from being deleted</I>.)<P>

If the <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> is given, the trigger commands
will not actually be run.<P>

Information about what <B>vrm</B> is going to do or has just done
is provided to the trigger commands through the following environment
variables:<P>

<DL>

<DT>VESTA_TOOL<DD>
The name of the Vesta tool the trigger command has been invoked from.
(For <B>vrm</B>, this will always be "vrm".)
<DT>VESTA_REPOS<DD>
The local repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) <B>vrm</B>
communicates with (either the default from the configuration file or
the one specified with the <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-R">-R flag</A>.
<DT>VESTA_PATH<DD>
The path being deleted by <B>vrm</B>.
<DT>VESTA_QUIET<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-q">the quiet flag (-q) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
</DL>
<P>

(Note that the environment variables are the same for both the pre and
post trigger commands.)<P>

Here are some examples using these environment variables:
<PRE>
[vrm pre trigger]
// Disallow any ghosting a master object under /vesta
50no_ghost_master = if echo $VESTA_PATH | grep -q '^/vesta/' &amp;&amp; vattrib -q -m $VESTA_PATH; then echo "Ghosting a master object not allowed"; exit 1; fi

[vrm post trigger]
// Add an attribute when an object under /vesta is ghosted
50record_ghosting = if vattrib -q -C ghost $VESTA_PATH; then vattrib -a "deletion-time" "`date`" $VESTA_PATH; fi
</PRE>

If the <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag (-v)</A> is given, these
environment variables will be printed, and each trigger command will
be printed before executing it.  This can be useful for debugging
trigger problems.  If both <A HREF="vrm.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag</A> and the
<A HREF="vrm.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> are given, the triggers are displayed
in their sorted order without actually running them.  This can be used
to find out what trigger commands are configured without actually
running them.

Scott Venier, Tim Mann, and Ken Schalk.  Yes, it took three of us to
delete enough code from other larger programs to leave this small one.
