VCacheStats prints statistics about the part of a Vesta-2 stable cache
rooted at <I>pathname</I>. If <I>pathname</I> is a relative path, it is
interpreted relative to the stable cache root specified in the user's
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#ConfigSect">Vesta configuration file</A>, as specified below. If
<I>pathname</I> is empty, statistics about the entire stable cache are
printed.<P>

The statistics printed by VCacheStats are grouped in two parts: the
first part prints fan-out statistics about the stable cache hierarchy,
and the second part prints statistics about various cache file and
cache entry attributes. These two categories are described in the next
two sections.<P>

VCacheStats searches the portion of the stable cache rooted at the
directory or file named by <I>pathname</I>. By default, the entire
stable cache is searched. To search a part of the stable cache,
specify one of the directories or MultiPKFiles listed by the
<A HREF="ShowCache.1.html">ShowCache(1)</A> program. To avoid problems
reading incomplete MultiPKFiles, any temporary files written by the
VestaAtomicFile package that are encountered during the search are
ignored.

<P>

The Vesta-2 cache server's stable cache is organized in a conceptual
hierarchy for fast lookup. Some parts of this conceptual hierarchy
correspond to files and directories in the physical file system
hierarchy. The levels of the stable cache hierarchy are:<P>

<DL>
<DT>Directories (levels 4 and higher)<DD>
To make lookups in the file system faster, the actual files that
contain cache entries are stored in a depth-2 directory tree. The root
of the tree is a directory named "<TT>gran-XXX</TT>", where "XXX" is the
implementation-dependent (decimal) number of bits of the primary key
that are ignored in grouping PKFiles into MultiPKFiles (see below).
The next two levels are each named by hex digits that encode part of
the 128 - XXX significant prefix bits of the primary key.<P>

<DT>MultiPKFiles (level 3)<DD>
Each cache entry has an associated fingerprint called its <I>primary
key</I> (PK). Cache entries are stored in disk files called <I>MultiPKFiles</I>.
A MultiPKFile is a collection of PKFiles, the next level down in the
hierarchy. Two PKFiles are in the same MultiPKFile if and only if
their corresponding primary keys (PK's) share some
implementation-dependent number of prefix bits in common.<P>

<DT>Primary Key Files (PKFiles) (level 2)<DD>
Within a MultiPKFile, cache entries are grouped by primary
key. A PKFile is a collection of cache entries that share the same PK.
PKFiles have various attributes described below.<P>

<DT>Common Fingerprint (CFP) Groups (level 1)<DD>
Each cache entry has an associated fingerprint called its
<I>common fingerprint</I> (CFP). Within each PKFile, cache entries
are grouped by common fingerprint values. In other words, each CFP
group within a PKFile is a collection of cache entries with the
same CFP value.<P>

<DT>Cache Entries (level 0)<DD>
At the leaves of the stable cache hierarchy are the individual cache
entries themselves. VCacheStats print the total number of cache
entries found in its search. Cache entries have various attributes
described below.
</DL>
<P>

For each level of the hierarchy, VCacheStats prints the number of
elements encountered at that level, and the minimum, mean, and maximum
<I>fanout</I> (i.e., number of children) encountered at that level. Here
an example of output produced by the program:
<PRE>
  *** FANOUT STATISTICS ***

  Directories (level 6):
    number = 1
    min = 1, mean = 1, max = 1

  Directories (level 5):
    number = 1
    min = 289, mean = 289, max = 289

  Directories (level 4):
    number = 289
    min = 1, mean = 1.03806, max = 2

  MultiPKFiles (level 3):
    number = 300
    min = 1, mean = 1, max = 1

  PKFiles (level 2):
    number = 300
    min = 1, mean = 17.66, max = 786

  Common finger print (CFP) groups (level 1):
    number = 5298
    min = 1, mean = 1.03473, max = 75

  Cache entries (level 0):
    number = 5482
</PRE>

Here is how the results for this particular run are interpreted.
Working up from the bottom, we see that the stable cache contains a
total of 5482 cache entries. These are grouped into 5298 CFP groups.
The average CFP group contains just over 1 cache entry. All of them
contain at least one entry, but there is at least one CFP group that
contains 75 cache entries. At the next level up, the cache contains
300 PKFiles. The average PKFile contains 17.66 CFP groups; at least
one PKFile contains 786 CFP groups! At level 3, there were also 300
MultiPKFiles found. Since the minimum, mean, and maximum number of
PKFiles per MultiPKFile is 1, we see that every MultiPKFile in the
stable cache contains exactly one PKFile. At level 4, most directories
contain one MultiPKFile, but some contain two. There is only one
directory at level 5, and it contains 289 level-4 directories.
Finally, the root directory of the stable cache at level 6 contains
exactly one directory.

<H3><A NAME="AttrSect">Attribute Statistics</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

VCacheStats also keeps statistics about various attributes of the
MultiPKFiles (at level 3), PKFiles (at level 2), and cache entries (at
level 0) it scans. As in the fanout statistics printed above, for each
attribute VCacheStats prints the number of values considered for each
attribute, and the minimum, mean, and maximum of those values. It also
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#histoOption">optionally</A> prints a histogram of those values.<P>

The <I>MultiPKFile attribute</I> and its meaning is:<P>

<DL>
<DT>MultiPKFile size (in bytes)<DD>
The size of the entire MultiPKFile on disk.
</DL>
<P>

The <I>PKFile attributes</I> and their meanings are:<P>

<DL>
<DT>PKFile size (in bytes)<DD>
The size of the PKFile proper within the MultiPKFile on disk.<P>

<DT>Number of free variables per PKFile<DD>
Stored in each PKFile are the names of <I>all</I> the free variables of
all the cache entries stored in the PKFile. VCacheStats prints the number
of free variable names per PKFile. Not all of these names are used by
all cache entries in the PKFile. See the statistics below for the
number of total and uncommon free variable names associated with cache
entries.<P>

<DT>Free variable name length<DD>
For each free variable stored in all the PKFiles it encounters,
VCacheStats records the length of the free variable name. It prints
the number of such free variables, and their minimum, mean, and
maximum lengths.<P>

<DT>Number of common free variables per PKFile<DD>
Also stored in each PKFile is the intersection of the free variable
names associated with the PKFile's cache entries. These are the
PKFile's so-called <I>common free variables</I>. This field is the
number of common free variables per PKFile. Only those cache entries
with at least one free variable (either common or uncommon) are
included in the statistics for this field.<P>

<DT>Percentage of common free variables per PKFile<DD>
The percentage of all a PKFile's names that are common. Only those
cache entries with at least one free variable (either common or
uncommon) are included in the statistics for this field.<P>

<DT>Number of cache entries per PKFile<DD>
The number of total cache entries in each PKFile. This data is similar
to the fanout statistics described above, but it ignores the grouping
of cache entries into common fingerprint groups at level 1.
</DL>
<P>

The <I>cache entry attributes</I> and their meanings are:<P>

<DL>
<DT>Number of total free variables per cache entry<DD>
Associated with each cache entry is the set of the entry's free
variables that are not common to all entries in the PKFile. These are
the cache entry's so-called <I>uncommon free variables</I>. This field
is the total number of common and uncommon free variables associated
with each invidual cache entry. It is also the total number of free
variable fingerprint values stored with the cache entry.<P>

<DT>Number of uncommon free variables per cache entry<DD>
This field is the number of uncommon free variables associated with
each individual cache entry. Only those cache entries with at
least one free variable (either common or uncommon) are included in
the statistics for this field.<P>

<DT>Percentage of uncommon free variables per cache entry<DD>
This field is the fraction of free variables per cache entry that are
uncommon, expressed as a percentage. Only those cache entries with at
least one free variable (either common or uncommon) are included in
the statistics for this field.<P>

<DT>Cache value size (in bytes)<DD>
Each entry has a pickled value. This field is
the size of the pickled value (in bytes).<P>

<DT>Number of derived indices (DI's) per cache value<DD>
Each entry has a set of indices of derived files contained in the
entry's pickled value. These are the cache values <I>derived indices</I>
(DI's). This field is the number of DI's per cache value.<P>

<DT>Number of child entries (kids) per cache entry<DD>
Each cache entry has an associated set of child cache entries. The
children correspond to functions called directly from the body of the
function to which the cache entry corresponds. This field is the
number of kids per cache entry.<P>

<DT>Number of entries in name index map per cache entry<DD>
The free variables corresponding to a cache entry are stored in the
cache entry's PKFile, so free variables that are common to many cache
entries within a PKFile will only be stored once. However, when a
cache entry is created, the order of the free variables supplied for
the entry will not necessarily agree with the order in which the
names, and more important, the order of the fingerprints of values
corresponding to those names, are stored in the PKFile.
The order of a cache entry's free variable fingerprints is important,
because the fingerprints must always be combined in a consistent order
determined by the order of the free variables stored in the PKFile.
Hence, associated with each cache entry is a mapping from indices
in the PKFile free variable array to indices in the cache entry's
fingerprint array. Sometimes, this mapping is the identity, in which
case no entries are stored in the map to save space. Otherwise, there
will be one entry in the name index map for each of the cache entry's
free variables. This field is the number of entries in the name index
map.<P>

<DT>Number of non-empty name index maps per cache entry (0 or 1)<DD>
As mentioned in the description of the previous attribute, the cache
server uses an empty table to represent the identity name index map.
This attribute is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the cache
entry's name index map is empty or not, respectively. The mean value
printed by VCacheStats is the fraction of cache entries that have
non-empty name index maps.<P>

<DT>Size of the cached value's PrefixTbl<DD>
Each value stored in the cache has an associated <TT>PrefixTbl</TT> data
structure.  This is used by the evaluator to store a compressed
representation of the dependencies associated with the cached value,
so that when an evaluation uses the stored value it can carry
dependency analysis forward.  (Because of internal limits, the maximum
size of this table is 65535.  Most functions never come anywhere near
this limit.)<P>

<DT>Number of redundant free variables per cache entry<DD>
As the evaluator records dependencies, it can have both a dependency
on a a complete compound value (e.g. a binding or list) and on some
sub-component of the same value.  In such cases, dependencies on the
sub-values do not record any additional information.  A future
implementation of the evaluator may eliminate redundant dependencies,
making this statistic unnecessary.  Note that unless the
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#-redundant"><B>-redundant</B></A> option is specified, this
statistic will not be gathered.<P>

<DT>Percentage redundant free variables per cache entry<DD>
Related to the above statistic, but computed as a percentage of total
free variables for each cache entry.  Unless the
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#-redundant"><B>-redundant</B></A> option is specified, this
statistic will not be gathered.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

When trying to identify model changes to improve caching performance,
it's often most useful to get a list of the functions with the highest
values in some categories.  You can use the
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#-report"><B>-report</B></A> option to generate such lists.  Also,
the <A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#-mask"><B>-mask</B></A> allows you to remove some functions from
the lists.<P>

The algorithm used to gather a list of "bad" functions is simple.
Each item processed during statistics collection is added to the "bad"
list if it's "worse" that the "least bad" item currently in the list.
(For all statistics but "Percentage of common free variables per
PKFile", a high value is considered worse than a low value.)  If this
increases the number of distinct <I>source function annotations</I>
present in the list above the <I>limit</I> given with
<A HREF="VCacheStats.1.html#-report"><B>-report</B></A>, the "least bad" item is removed
repeatedly until the the number of functions is no longer above the
limit.<P>

<P>

VCacheStats recognizes the following command-line options:<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="histoOption"><B>-histo</B></A><DD>
In addition to printing the minimum, mean, and maximum value in each
collection, a histogram of the values in the collection is also
printed. The histogram printout takes the form:
<PRE>
{ value_i -&gt; number_i }
</PRE>

The histogram means that the "value_i" occurred in the collection
"number_i" times.<P>

Since the domains of some collections are sparse, some categories have
a function applied to their domain to make the histogram printed
more dense. Since all domains are integer-valued, the function maps
integers to integers. In the case where a histogram mapping function 
is applied, a description of that function is printed before the
histogram itself. For example:
<PRE>
Cache value size (in bytes):
  number = 14
  min = 301, mean = 3649.36, max = 11389
  Histogram mapping function: ceiling(log_2(x))
  { 9 -&gt; 5, 10 -&gt; 1, 11 -&gt; 2, 13 -&gt; 5, 14 -&gt; 1 }
</PRE>

In this example, the histogram domain values correspond to the ceiling
of the log (base 2) of the cache value size. Hence, five cache values had
sizes in the half-open interval (2^8, 2^9], while one had a size in
the range (2^13, 2^14].<P>

<DT><A NAME="minMaxOption"><B>-min</B> or <B>-max</B></A><DD>

<LI> The <I>primary key</I> and <I>source function annotation</I> of a
PKFile
<LI> The <I>common fingerprint</I> of a CFP group and <I>names epoch</I>

<LI> The <I>cache index</I> of a cache entry
</UL>
<P>

<DT><A NAME="vOption"><B>-v</B> <I>or</I> <B>-verbose</B></A><DD>

<DT><A NAME="VOption"><B>-V</B> <I>or</I> <B>-Verbose</B></A><DD>

expensive, so it's turned off by default.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-report"><B>-report</B> <I>statistic</I> <I>limit</I></A><DD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, VCacheStats reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. The program first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The variables used by
VCacheStats are in the section denoted by <TT>[CacheServer]</TT>. Here
are the variables and their meanings; the types of the variables are
shown in parentheses. Those variables corresponding to paths or
directories should <I>not</I> end with a slash ("/") character.<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
Other configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>SCacheDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which the
cache server stores cache entries.

<DL>
<DT><TT>vesta.cfg</TT><DD>
The Vesta-2 configuration file.  (See
<A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html#Locations">the vesta.cfg(5) man page</A> for a
description of how the config file is located.)<P>

<DT><TT>$MetaDataRoot/$MetatDataDir/$SCacheDir/</TT><DD>
The root of the sub-tree in which stable cache entry files (also known
as MultiPKFiles) are stored. The files are stored under a pathname
formed from their respective primary keys. See 
<A HREF="ShowCache.1.html">ShowCache(1)</A> and
<A HREF="PrintMPKFile.1.html">PrintMPKFile(1)</A>.

In the event of an I/O error, such as not being able to open a file or
a filesystem failure, the program prints an error message and halts.<P>

If the <I>pathname</I> argument names a directory, VCacheStats expects
the MultiPKFiles directly or indirectly reachable from that directory
to have uniform depth in the directory tree. This is the way the cache
server's stable cache is organized. If that is not the case,
VCacheStats will print an error message and halt.

Since version 1 of the MultiPKFile file format didn't include a magic
number, VCacheStats cannot tell the difference between these old
MultiPKFiles and arbitrary files. The program assumes that any file it
encounters in its search that is not a directory is a MultiPKFile. If
it tries to read a file that begins with bytes indicating version 1 of
the MultiPKFile format but that is not a true MultiPKFile, it will
probably crash. If it tries to read any other kind of file that is not
a MultiPKFile, it reports an error.
