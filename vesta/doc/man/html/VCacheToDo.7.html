These are the major items that still need to be done. In some cases,
a small amount of design work is required.<P>

<UL>
<LI>
There is a design for how the cache server could be partitioned into
multiple processes, each one serving a subset of the cache entries,
but no aspects of that design have been implemented.

<P>

These are items that must be taken care of before the cache server is
completed.<P>

<UL>
<LI>
We need to develop a cache-wide policy for deciding which (old)
entries to cache in memory. Currently, only a local policy has been
implemented. As a result, the number of "warm" cache entries
retained in memory is potentially unbounded.<P>

The current policy works as follows. Whenever a hit occurs to an entry
on disk, that entry is loaded into the corresponding volatile PKFile
as a "warm" cache entry. When a volatile PKFile is flushed to disk,
its new entries are flushed to disk. Which entries remain in the
volatile PKFile after that are determined by the configuration
variables [CacheServer]/KeepNewOnFlush and
[CacheServer]/KeepOldOnFlush. By default, no entries are retained. See
the <A HREF="VCache.1.html#ConfigSect">VCache(1)</A> man page for details.<P>

<LI>
When VPKFile's become empty, they are currently not
being removed from the <TT>CacheS::cache</TT> table or the corresponding
VMultiPKFile. Similarly, when a VMultiPKFile becomes empty, it is not
being removed from the <TT>CacheS::mpkTbl</TT> table (see
<TT>CacheS::VToSCache</TT>).<P>

<LI>
The <TT>SVCache</TT> spec allows the <TT>SetHitFilter</TT> and <TT>EndMark</TT>
procedures to change <TT>hitFilter</TT> non-atomically, but the current
implementation doesn't exploit that freedom. This means that the cache
server's global lock is held for a longer period of time than strictly
necessary, potentially blocking calls on the server.

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Sep  5 2000 by <A HREF="mailto:ken@xorian.net">KCS</A></TT><DD>
Several race conditions in writing to the stable cache have been
fixed.  First, it was possible for a second call to one of the cache
server's log-flushing methods (<TT>CacheS::FlushUsedCIs</TT>,
<TT>CacheS::FlushGraphLog</TT>, <TT>CacheS::FlushCacheLog</TT>) to return if
there was nothing to flush, even if another thread was still in the
process of flushing the corresponding log.  This could allow
information to be written to disk out of order, resulting in
inconsistent stable state.  This was corrected by forcing the flushing
methods to always make use of the <TT>FlushQueue</TT> mechanism.
Secondly, there was a race condition in the code for VToSCache which
allowed new entries to be added to the MultiPKFile being flushed
between the time the graphLog (and hence, the usedCILog) were flushed
and the time the VPKFiles within the MultiPKFile were
checkpointed. This made it possible for a new entry created during
that window to appear in the stable cache without appearing in the
graphLog, thereby violating one of the cache invariants (B7x,
according to the todo item previously listed above).  The VPKFiles are
now checkpointed <I>before</I> the graph log is flushed, thereby
guaranteeing that all entries written to a MultiPKFile will have their
CI allocations and graph log entries recorded.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jul  6 09:17:54 PDT 1998 by heydon</TT><DD>
The code that arranges to call the routine for cleaning the cache log
is overly simple. This item was addressed quite a while ago, but I
only recently noticed it was no longer a problem.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Apr 15 09:23:10 PDT 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped v1.11.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Apr 14 09:21:59 PDT 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed bug in leases implementation in which the backround expiration
thread was deadlocking. The problem was that the Leases::Debug method
had too low a locking level.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Mar 24 16:28:07 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped v1.10.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Mar 24 16:27:44 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added code to prune the usedCILog and graphLog.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Mar 18 14:00:20 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped v1.9.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Mar 18 13:47:48 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added a timestamp to <TT>Root</TT> entries in the graphLog. Currently,
this field is unused, but in the future it may be used by the weeder
to automatically keep roots that are new enough, even if the weeder
wasn't explicitly told to keep them.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Mar 18 13:46:48 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed recovery code so that it no longer reverts from cache
state 1 back to state 0. This work is now done in the WeederRecovering
method, but only if the weeder did not finish its marking work.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Mar 18 10:37:25 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed bug in recovery of emptyPKLog in which all records but the first
in the emptyPKLog for a given PK were being ignored.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Mar 17 10:39:16 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Made many changes to the cache server's weeder interface.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Mar 13 10:39:16 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped v1.8.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Feb 27 10:39:16 PST 1997 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed the signature of the Checkpoint method to include
the fingerprint of the directory containing the evaluated
model.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 19 16:49:37 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped v1.7.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 19 15:53:22 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added <B>-n</B> switch to <A HREF="CreateCacheDirs.1.html">CreateCacheDirs(1)</A>.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 19 15:35:05 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed BitVector's to use slightly more compact representation
in memory and on disk.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 19 09:32:08 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added new "isEmpty" result to the "FreeVariables" method.
This required that the cache server protocol version be
incremented.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Dec 18 15:23:19 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed VCache::HandleFailure to print the error message
in all cases (even if the debugging level is "None") if
it represents a non-standard SRPC failure.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Dec 18 15:21:40 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed memory smash bug in VestaVal::T::Print. A value of
type <TT>signed char</TT> was being cast to a value of type
<TT>unsigned int</TT>; sign extension was causing the sprintf
of the resulting value to overflow the buffer. I added
assertions to all similar sprintf statements to assure
that they weren't overflowing their buffers.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 12 16:45:10 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.6.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 12 15:31:08 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Occassionally, the MultiPKFiles were being created with bizarre
names. The bug turned out to be in the use of the "form" function
in the SMultiPKFile::Name method. This function does not seem
to be thread-safe. All uses of the "form" function have now
been eliminated.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Dec 11 13:36:46 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed a bug in PrintCacheLog in which EmptyPKLog was not being
opened read-only. This meant that vestasrv priviledges were
required to run the program. Opening the file read-only
fixes that problem.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Dec  4 11:53:14 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped new <A HREF="VCacheToDo.7.html"CleanCache.1.html"">CleanCache(1)</A> script.
Also, made <A HREF="VCacheToDo.7.html"EraseCache.1.html"">EraseCache(1)</A> and
<A HREF="VCacheToDo.7.html"ShowCache.1.html"">ShowCache(1)</A> scripts more robust.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Dec  4 08:42:56 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.5. This version writes a magic number into
the header of a MultiPKFile.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Dec  2 13:38:04 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped new <A HREF="VCacheToDo.7.html"VCacheStats.1.html"">VCacheStats(1)</A> program.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Nov 25 13:40:14 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.4. Mainly, this was to pick up new libraries. In
addition, this version no longer supports the GetLookupStats method,
since that information (and lots more) can now be collected using etp
and pspec.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Oct 28 11:42:10 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.3.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Oct 28 11:40:59 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added support to SMultiPKFileRep::Header::Write for writing
entries of type <TT>SMultiPKFileRep::HT_SortedList</TT>.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Sat Oct 26 15:37:28 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.2.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Sat Oct 26 15:03:57 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added support for writing SPKFile header entry format
<TT>SPKFileRep::HT_SortedList</TT>; also added support to
<TT>SPKFile::LookupCFP</TT> for looking up common fingerprints
efficiently for that header entry format.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Oct 23 09:22:22 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.1.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Oct 22 23:43:05 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed cache server and SRPC implementation so no forked
thread ever dies; instead, they loop endlessly waiting on
a condition variable for work to do. This was done in the
hope of avoiding the garbage collector crash.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Oct  9 17:56:42 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
There is a race condition in AddEntry: the test that leases on
the "kids" and on the deriveds have not expired must be moved
to <I>after</I> the code that writes the graphLog entry. As it is
now, the code differs from the spec: the test now occurs even
before the new CI is created and leased. But the spec is wrong
too: the test must occur after the graphLog entry is written.
Otherwise, the following could happen. First, the test for necessary
leases might pass. Then, between that time and the time the graph
log entry is written, one of the necessary child or derived leases
might expire. If the weeder ran, the corresponding entry or derived
would be deleted, since the graph log entry that would protect it
has yet to be written. We would then create a cache entry that
contained a non-existent child or derived! Hence, we must write
a speculative graphLog entry, and then check that the necessary
leases exist before creating and installing the entry. If that
test fails, we may have a "ghost" entry in the graph log, but
it will not have a parent to protect it, and eventually its
lease will expire. It will then be deleted from the graph log
by the weeded, at which point the cache server can re-use its
cache index.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Oct  1 14:36:04 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed a bug in QuickWeed(1): it was not handling the case
in which the repository call to create a file was failing.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Sep 24 15:30:35 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Shipped VCache v1.0. This was the first version of the cache
server that printed an explicit version number.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Sep 24 15:08:41 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed QuickWeed(1) to weed against multiple caches.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Sep 23 17:20:26 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed QuickWeed(1) to detect if an error occurs writing the
derived keep file, and to abort in the event of such an error.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Sep 23 16:56:04 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed EraseCache(1) script so it now asks for confirmation before
deleting anything.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Sep 16 11:28:15 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Once copies were made of cache entries at MultiPKFile flush time,
the previous change was not necessary. Now that the cache entries
in VPKFiles are immutable, so there is no reason the entries in
the cache log cannot contain pointers to those entries.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Sep 13 17:36:57 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
There is a bug with the storage of cache entries in the
volatile cache log. The problem is that the cache log stores
a <I>pointer</I> to the newly-added cache entry. Because of this
alias, there is a race condition: the cache entry is not protected
by the appropriate VPKFile lock when the cache log is flushed to
disk. This could produce a crash as follows: if two threads
simultaneously flush the cache log and a MultiPKFile to stable
storage, the thread flushing the MultiPKFile might modify a
new cache entry in the course of updating its common names. The
modified entry might then be flushed to the cache log before the
new version of the MultiPKFile was committed. If the server then
crashed, it would see the modified entry on recovery. To avoid a race,
the cache log must store <I>copies</I> of any mutable cache entry fields.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Sep 13 17:36:32 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
There is a race in <I>SMultiPKFile::Rewrite</I>: some fields
of a <I>VPKFileChkPt</I> point back to the original VPKFile,
so they should only be accessed with the VPKFile lock held.
In particular, combined fingerprints may be unlazied in the
process of flushing the entries to disk, so a lock must be
held for those operations. The fix is for the checkpoint to
include <I>copies</I> of the mutable fields of any cache entries
in the initial VPKFile.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Sep 13 14:54:36 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
When a log is checkpointed, any old logs and checkpoints associated
with it should be deleted. Tim will be adding this functionality to
VestaLog, so the cache server will pick it up for free.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Sep 13 14:37:38 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed <I>PrintCacheLog</I> and <I>PrintGraphLog</I> programs
to open the logs in read-only mode. As a result, these programs
no longer have to be run as <TT>vestasrv</TT>.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Sep  9 16:58:18 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Change <TT>CacheS::FlushAll</TT> so it forks threads to flush
up to five MultiPKFiles to the stable cache at once.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Sep  9 15:09:13 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
When a short string (such as a ShortId) is fingerprinted,
only the high-order bits of the fingerprint words are significant.
Unfortunately, the <TT>PKPrefix</TT> interface was selecting
these insignificant bits from the PK to use to form the name of the
corresponding MultiPKFile. As a result, many otherwise-unrelated PK's
were ending up in the same MultiPKFile. I've changed the PKPrefix
interface to use the high-order bits instead.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Sat Sep  7 19:54:49 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The EraseCache(1) program should not allow the possibility
of deleting the logs without deleting all of the stable
MultiPKFiles. This will lead to problems. For example, if
the <I>usedCIs</I> log is deleted, the first new entry will
be assigned a cache index (CI) of 0. But there may already
be a cache entry with index 0 in the stable cache! So I've
removed the <B>-entries</B> option from EraseCache(1); now
that program always deletes the stable cache files.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Sep  6 19:17:22 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
There was a bug in <TT>SMultiPKFileRep::AppendNewHeaderEntry</TT>.
This bug was actually causing a memory smash whenever a
MultiPKFile was flushed to disk!<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Sep  4 19:27:31 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
An assertion in the code for reading a SPKFile was
failing due to a PKFile growing larger than 64K. Each
<I>SPKFileRep::HeaderEntry</I> contains an offset to
the start of each list of entries (grouped by common
fingerprint). The offset was being stored as a 2-byte
<TT>unsigned short</TT>, which was not large enough to
hold values over 64K.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Sep  4 19:27:02 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Yuan reported a bug in which flush a MultiPKFile to disk
was failing. The failure was evinced by an <I>FS::Failure</I>
exception indicating a seek failure to location 0 of the
original (non-existent) MultiPKFile. The bug is caused
by the case in which the table of VPKFiles to flush contains
some VPKFiles with no new entries, yet those VPKFiles do
not exist in the MultiPKFile on disk. The fix is to simply
not include those VPKFiles in the MultiPKFile header, so they
will not be written to disk.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jul 22 14:24:40 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Implemented policy for caching "warm" cache entries in a
VPKFile's <I>oldEntries</I> table. New code was necessary to
get the entries from the in-memory SPKFile rather than updating
the old entries in memory (as was originally done). The problem
with the original strategy is that "warm" entries produced
from disk hits were incomplete, and so did not have sufficient
information (such as a complete list of fingerprints) to be
updated when the PKFile's set of common names changed at
PKFile flush-time.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Jul 19 08:29:49 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Removed all timestamps and the max-timestamp heuristic from
the cache server code. For the rationale behind this change,
see my post to src.vesta on 15-July-96.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jul 15 10:32:47 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added <I>GetLookupStats</I> method for reporting statistics about
the cache server's <I>Lookup</I> method.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jul  8 11:53:18 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed printing routines so PrintMPKFile(1) would use a multi-line
format for the "allNames" and "imap" fields.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jul  1 13:42:21 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed PrintMPKFile(1) to take relative pathnames as well as absolute
ones. Relative pathnames are interpreted relative to the directories
specified in the Vesta configuration file.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Jun 27 15:10:04 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed recovery bugs that were not updating the length of stable cache
log or the number of entries in a VMultiPKFile correctly.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jun 24 13:51:42 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Fixed bug in CacheS.C that was causing the cache server to crash if it
did not detect the right files in its metadata directory structure.
The bug was due to an unhandled exception, and was fixed by moving a
call inside an existing "try" scope.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu May 23 12:41:41 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added <B>-noHits</B> command-line option.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu May  9 16:26:46 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Implemented the "CleanCacheLog" routine and arranged for it
to be called automatically whenever the size of the cache log
exceeds some threshold.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu May  9 16:25:46 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
For now, the only calls to CacheS::VToSCache are in
CacheS::Checkpoint and in the DoDeletions thread. The Checkpoint
method flushes <I>all</I> pending VMultiPKFiles, one at a time. The
server should be changed to invoke VToSCache based on some
resource-usage policy. Currently, the solution is to flush
a volitile MultiPKFile when the number of entries in it exceeds
some threshold. <P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Apr 12 18:51:00 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added code to print names and timestamps one per line.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Apr 12 18:39:38 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The code for recovering the cache log was going to disk to
reach the "pkEpoch" on every entry in the log. I added a
temporary table mapping PK's to their pkEpoch's to improve
the efficiency of recovering the cache log.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Apr 12 18:38:16 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The locking level requirements were not being respected
during recovery. I changed the recovery code to acquire
the appropriate locks in a correct order.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Tue Apr  9 17:08:52 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The table constructed at recovery from the EmptyPKLog needs to be
preserved in memory and used to initialize the "pkEpoch" of newly-
created VPKFiles. Also, it needs to be augmented when an
SPKFile is deleted and have an entry removed when a non-empty
SPKFile is written.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Apr  8 15:09:01 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
I removed the locks associated with VMultiPKFiles. Now,
the fields of a VMultiPKFile are protected by the centralized
lock "CacheS.mu".<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Sun Apr  7 15:02:51 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The cache server specification contained a mistake in which
deleted entries were not being ignored when the cache log
was recovered. I designed and implemented a
<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#CacheLog"><I>pkEpoch algorithm</I></A>
for ignoring deleted and flushed entries in the cache log.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Fri Apr  5 15:03:48 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Added "fvs" return value to the cache server "Lookup" method
as requested by Yuan.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Wed Apr  3 15:03:11 PDT 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
Changed cache server client interface so that free variables
are represented by Text sequences instead of as simple Texts
as requested by Yuan. The new free variable types are defined
in the "FV2" interface.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Mar 18 16:02:32 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
When a MultiPKFile is empty, we currently delete the file. However, if
there are no longer any files in its directory, we should remove the
directory (and recursively).<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Mar 18 11:52:21 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
When the "WeededMPKs" log is checkpointed, the old log and (empty)
checkpoint file are no longer needed and can be deleted. The "version"

Once we support deleting an SPKFile from a MultiPKFile, it is possible

<TT>SMultiPKFile::Rewrite</TT> does not yet support <I>deleting</I> of

<TT>SPKFile::Update</TT> does not yet support <I>deleting</I> of entries. Once it

MultiPKFile, and the corresponding VPKFile should be removed from the
cache.<P>

Once the weeder is implemented, the set of common names may
actually <I>grow</I> at VtoSCache time. Currently, the methods for
recomputing the fingerprints of existing cache entries at this
time are written under the assumption that the common names will
only get smaller (and hence, that the uncommon names will only be
augmented). Is there a way to generalize this code (using XOR
instead of OR?) to handle the new case once the weeder is
implemented?<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon Jan 22 18:24:08 PST 1996 by heydon</TT><DD>
The cache server's weeder interface still needs to be designed and
implemented. New code will also be necessary to handle the deletion of
deriveds and cache entries (see more specific items below).<P>

Currently, <TT>AddEntry</TT> chooses new <TT>ci</TT> by finding an unset bit in the

There is no facility for disabling lease expiration.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Dec 14 17:28:51 PST 1995 by heydon</TT><DD>
We still need a way for the cache to detect if a derived lease has
expired. This mechanism has been designed (see Allan's post to
src.vesta on 14-Dec-95), but it has not been implemented. As described
in that message, the interface to the cache server will have to change
to include an extra timestamp argument to the <I>AddEntry</I> method.
The cache server also has to export a new <I>RenewLease</I> method for
renewing the lease on a specified cache entry.<P>

Currently, the names in a VPKFile are stored twice: once in the
<TT>allNames</TT> list and once in the <TT>nameMap</TT> table. It seems a bit of
a waste to store the strings themselves twice. Perhaps the type of
<TT>allNames</TT> should be changed to a list of <I>pointers</I> to texts to
save space?<P>

Solution: The actual solution was to provide an alternate
implementation of the <TT>Text</TT> interface in the vesta/basics package
that copies pointers rather than buffers when texts are copied.<P>

VPKFile::VPKFile(fp) should read the SPKFile from the stable cache

The <TT>SMultiPKFile::OpenAtomicWrite</TT> method does not create any

Add a <TT>void Copy(T &amp;tbl) throw ()</TT> method to <TT>Table::T</TT>. This
makes the table object a (shallow) copy of <TT>tbl</TT>. It could be used
in <TT>VPKFile::CheckPoint</TT> and <TT>VMultiPKFile::ToSCache</TT>, among other

takes a <TT>(const T *tbl)</TT> argument; this would simply call
<TT>Copy(*tbl)</TT>.<P>

Provide a "copy constructor" for a <TT>BitVector</TT> that takes a

Currently, the method <TT>CacheEntry::NewEntry</TT> sets the <TT>commonNames</TT>
to the set of all free variables when the very first entry is added
under a PK. This violates invariant B2v of the spec, but it makes
for better testing until we actually have stable PKFiles. There is
a comment in this method that describes how to change the code to
make it correct.<P>

Change LimService interface so the <TT>handle_failure</TT> callback takes
an extra (void*) arg. Then, change the cache server so SRPC

Currently, the implementation of <TT>CacheC</TT> ignores SRPC failures.
Should they be exposed to the client? Should we attempt to catch SRPC
failures due to programming errors and crash the program in such
cases (as is currently done in LimService)?<P>

Solution: We simply relay SRPC::failure exceptions to the client.
(Actually, we catch them in some cases, but then rethrow them.)<P>

When Roy releases new SRPC interface, use the constructor for the
<TT>failure</TT> class in <TT>LimService</TT> where a new failure is consed
together and thrown.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Thu Aug 31 11:39:49 PDT 1995 by heydon</TT> (actually earlier)<DD>
Currently, <TT>LimService</TT> attempts to distinguish <TT>SRPC::failure</TT>
exceptions due to programming errors from those due to system
failures. Roy believes this is not robust; the two classes of
errors cannot be distinguished by failure code alone.<P>

For now, <TT>LimService</TT> writes an error message and dies if it
detects a failure due to what it thinks is a programming error.
Roy says he may want to simply catch programming errors in <TT>SRPC</TT>,
in which case only the failure with code <TT>LSErrorCode</TT> should be
caught in <TT>LimService</TT> as a fatal programming error (this code is
used if the SRPC connection is no longer alive after the callback
procedure has returned -- it can only occur if the programmer of the
callback routine catches SRPC::failure contrary to the
requirements of the callback routine spec).<P>

Solution: In LimService, we only catch the failure with internal
code <TT>LSErrorCode</TT>. All other failures are reported by invoking
the user-supplied <TT>FailureCallBack</TT>.<P>

It might be a performance win to store the uncommon names in the
CacheEntries rather than (or in addition to) the set of all names for
that entry. Storing only the uncommon names might be possible, since
it can only grow to include new elements. This means that the
<TT>UpdateTags</TT> method would need to take an extra bit vector of the
names that were once common that no longer are.<P>

<DT><TT>Done on Mon May  1 17:54:24 PDT 1995 by heydon</TT><DD>
The <TT>PKFile::AddEntry</TT> method allocates a new <TT>TextKey</TT> for each
of the free variables. This seems like a waste, since the <TT>TextKey</TT>
values that are not inserted into the <TT>nameMap</TT> are deleted
immediately. However, the creation of each <TT>TextKey</TT> requires that
space for the string be allocated, and the string characters copied.
That seems a waste; it would be better to allocate new <TT>TextKey</TT>'s
only for those names that are new and must be inserted into the
<TT>nameMap</TT>.<P>

In Marshall.cxx, fix the routines for marshalling and unmarshalling
lists of fingerprints to use generic sequences, rather than sequences
of strings. The current implementation breaks if any of the
fingerprints contains a '\0' character, since it will be treated as
a terminator.
