See the <A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page's
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section for
definitions of terms, and its
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A>
section for an explanation of how names are looked up.<P>

The <B>vmkdir</B> command creates a new directory in the Vesta
repository.  This provides an alternative to creating a directory with
the normal <B>mkdir</B> command through the repository's NFS interface
(which in some cases doesn't work depending on the quirks of different
NFS client implementations).  It also makes it possible to create a
directory in a remote repository and acquire local mastership of it
with one command.<P>

You must have write access to the directory in which <I>directory</I> is
to be placed. The newly created directory is owned by you, but has
access permissions inherited from its parent directory.<P>

In the presence of replication, the directory creation cannot always
be carried out in the local repository.  In particular, the local
repository may not have the master copy of the parent directory.
Also, the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-a/-A</A> flags control which repository
<B>vmkdir</B> will give mastership of the created directory.  (See
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> and
<A HREF="vmaster.1.html"><B>vmaster</B>(1)</A> for more information about
replication and mastership.)<P>

If the parent directory is mastered locally, <B>vmkdir</B> creates the
new directory in the local repository (and the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-a/-A</A>
flags have no effect).<P>

If the parent directory is not mastered locally, <B>vmkdir</B> may give
mastership of <I>directory</I> to the local repository, if either the
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-a</A> flag is specified or
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#vmkdir_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vmkdir_acquires</I></A> is set to
true.  In this case, it creates the directory remotely in the master
copy, replicates it to the local repository, and transfers mastership.<P>

If the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-A</A> flag is specified or
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#vmkdir_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vmkdir_acquires</I></A> is set to
false and the parent directory is mastered remotely, <B>vmkdir</B> will
leave mastership of the new directory with the master repository of
its parent directory.  It creates the directory remotely in the master
copy and replicates it to the local repository.<P>

Without the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-f">-f</A> flag, <B>vmkdir</B> will refuse to create a
directory anywhere inside a package or branch (that is, in any
directory whose <TT>type</TT> attribute contains any of the following
values: <TT>package</TT>, <TT>branch</TT>, <TT>checkout</TT>, <TT>session</TT>).<P>

The <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-p">-p</A> flag is a convenience feature which causes
<B>vmkdir</B> to give the created directory type "<TT>package-parent</TT>",
which allows packages to be created as children of the new directory.<P>

Creating a directory that is directly below the repository root
(<TT>/vesta</TT>) is a special case (as there is <B>no</B> master copy of
the repository root).  To create such a top-level directory, you must
be the special <I>wizard user</I>.  Also, all top-level directories must
be globally unique across all repositories in the universe in the
past, present, or future.  We strongly recommend that every name you
create in this directory be an Internet domain name that belongs to
you (or, failing that, an e-mail address with '@' changed to '_'); if
everyone follows this convention, uniqueness is guaranteed.  (See the
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Vesta_Replication"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> and
<A HREF="repository.8.html#Warning"><B>repository</B>(8)</A> man pages for
more information.)  Before creating a top-level directory, <B>vmkdir</B>
will remind you of this and ask for confirmation.<P>

<B>vmkdir</B> returns status 0 for success, 1 for parameter syntax
errors, or 2 for more serious errors.  (Note that if any of the
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Triggers">trigger commands</A> fail, <B>vmkdir</B> returns status
2.)

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-q">-q</A><DD>
Quiet; suppress printing out what is being done.
<DT><A NAME="-Q">-Q</A><DD>
Query; print out what the command would do, but don't do it.
<DT><A NAME="-h">-h</A> <I>hints</I><DD>
If <B>vmkdir</B> fails to find the master copy of the parent directory
either the local repository or any of those repositories listed in
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Configuration"><I>[UserInterface]DefaultHints</I></A>, you can
suggest additional repositories for it to look in using this option.
The <I>hints</I> argument is a comma- or space-separated list of
repositories, specified by host name and TCP port number in the format
<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.  The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted;
it defaults to
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-R">-R</A> <I>repos</I><DD>
Create the directory in <I>repos</I> instead of the default local
repository.  The repository is
specified by host name and TCP port number 
in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it
defaults to <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-aA">-a or -A</A><DD>
Do (-a) or do not (-A) acquire mastership of the created directory
when the local repository doesn't have mastership of the parent
directory.  The default is controlled by the
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#vmkdir_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vmkdir_acquires</I></A>
configuration setting.  (Note that if the parent directory of
<I>directory</I> is mastered in the local repository, these flags have
no effect.)
<DT><A NAME="-p">-p</A><DD>
Give the created directory the type "<TT>package-parent</TT>" (that is, a
<TT>type</TT> attribute with this value).  This allows packages to be
created as children of the new directory.  (See the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html"><B>vcreate</B>(1)</A> man page for more information.)
<DT><A NAME="-f">-f</A><DD>
Force; omit sanity checking.  If the -f flag is not given, the new
directory's parent may not be any part of a package or branch (that
is, a directory with a <TT>type</TT> attribute that contains any of the
following values: <TT>package</TT>, <TT>branch</TT>, <TT>checkout</TT>,
<TT>session</TT>).
<DT><A NAME="-v">-v</A><DD>
Displays extra information about <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Triggers">triggers</A>.  Before
executing any trigger commands, the environment variables used to
provide information to them are printed.  Also, each trigger setting
is printed before the command is executed.  This can be used to help
debug trigger problems.  When used with <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-Q">the query flag
(-Q)</A>, the triggers are displayed in their sorted order without
actually running them.

<H3><A NAME="Configuration">Configuration</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[UserInterface]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file (vesta.cfg).<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>AppendableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the global root directory of
Vesta repositories is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta</TT>.
<DT><I>MutableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the local tree of mutable directories provided
by Vesta is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta-work</TT>.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is optional.  If it is not set,
<TT>[Repository]realm</TT> is used.
<DT><I>TimeFormat</I><DD>
A format string for <B>strftime</B>(3) to produce time strings for Vesta
attributes.  A common setting is "%a %b %e %T %Z %Y".
<DT><A NAME="vmkdir_acquires"><I>vmkdir_acquires</I></A><DD>
Sets the default policy for which repository should have mastership of
the created directory when the master repository of the parent
directory is remote.  If it is equal (witout regard to case) to "yes",
"on", or "true", or can be parsed as an integer that is non-zero, the
local repository will acquire mastership (as if the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-a</A>
flag had been given).  If it is equal (witout regard to case) to "no",
"off", or "false", or can be parsed as an integer that is zero, the
master repository of the parent directory will retain mastership of
the created directory (as if the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">-A</A> flag had been given).
If not set, defaults to "false".
<DT><I>DefaultHints</I><DD>
A comma- or space-separated list of additional repositories to search
for the master copy of an object.  Each repository is specified by
host name and TCP port number in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it defaults to
<I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I>.  This setting is optional.
</DL>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[Repository]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file.
<DL>
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_host</I><DD>
The host name of the default (local) repository.
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_port</I><DD>
The default TCP port number for repositories.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is only used if <TT>[UserInterface]realm</TT> is
not set.
</DL>
<P>

The following value is obtained from the <TT>[Run_Tool]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file.
<DL>
<DT><I>VolatileRootName</I><DD>
The mount point used for temporary directories used during tool
invocations.  Attempting to create a directory inside the volatile
root (which is often below the mutable root) is considered an error.
</DL>
<P>

Settings in the <TT>[vmkdir pre trigger]</TT> and <TT>[vmkdir post
trigger]</TT> sections of the configuration file are used as commands to
be run before and after the repository is modified.  See
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Triggers">the next section</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Triggers">Triggers</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Users can configure commands in <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html">the Vesta
configuration file (vesta.cfg)</A> to be executed before and after
<B>vmkdir</B> modifies the repository.  Each setting in the <TT>[vmkdir
pre trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run before any action
is taken, and each setting in the <TT>[vmkdir post trigger]</TT> section
specifies a command to be run after all actions are complete.<P>

The value of each setting specifies a command to run.  The names of
the settings define the order in which these commands are run.  The
setting names are sorted as strings, but comparing embedded sequences
of digits as decimal integers.  (So, for example "foo_10_bar" will
sort after "foo_2_bar".)  The suggested naming convention for trigger
settings is to start with an integer, follow with a descriptive name,
and follow that with any other text.  (This is based on the convention
used for System V style init script links typically stored in
<TT>/etc/rc<I><B>N</B></I>.d</TT>.)<P>

Here's a simple example of how we suggest naming trigger settings, and
how they are ordered for execution:
<PRE>
[vmkdir pre trigger]
100world = echo World!
9tada    = echo Tada:
50hello  = echo Hello,
</PRE>

Because these all start with numbers, they will be executed in the
order "9tada", "50hello", "100world".  The output will look like this:
<PRE>
% vmkdir /vesta/example.com/...
Tada:
Hello,
World!
Creating directory /vesta/example.com/...
</PRE>

Trigger commands are executed with <TT>system</TT>(3).  On most operating
systems this means "<TT>/bin/sh -c <I>command</I></TT>", so simple in-line
shell scripts can be used.  (Note that each is executed in its own
shell process, so environment variables set during one trigger command
<I>will not propagate to subsequent ones</I>.)<P>

If any of the commands in the <TT>[vmkdir pre trigger]</TT> section exit
with error (non-zero) status or are terminated by a signal
(e.g. segmentation fault, abort), <B>vmkdir</B> will exit without
creating a directory.<P>

The commands in the <TT>[vmkdir post trigger]</TT> section will only be
executed if a new directory is successfully created.  If <B>vmkdir</B>
fails with an error, the commands in the <TT>[vmkdir post trigger]</TT>
section <I>will not be executed</I>.<P>

Note that all the trigger commands (both pre and post) are executed
sequentially.  Once a trigger command is started, nothing else happens
until it completes.  If any of the pre trigger commands runs forever,
<B>vmkdir</B> will not create a directory.  If any of the post trigger
commands runs forever, <B>vmkdir</B> will not complete.  (In other
words, <I>a trigger command that hangs will cause <B>vmkdir</B> to
hang</I>.)  If any of the pre or post trigger commands exit with error
status or are terminated by a signal, <B>vmkdir</B> will exit without
running any more commands from those sections.  (In other words, <I>a
trigger command that fails will prevent further trigger commands from
being run</I>.)<P>

If the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> is given, the trigger commands
will not actually be run.<P>

Information about what <B>vmkdir</B> is going to do or has just done
is provided to the trigger commands through the following environment
variables:<P>

<DL>

<DT>VESTA_TOOL<DD>
The name of the Vesta tool the trigger command has been invoked from.
(For <B>vmkdir</B>, this will always be "vmkdir".)
<DT>VESTA_REPOS<DD>
The local repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) <B>vmkdir</B>
communicates with (either the default from the configuration file or
the one specified with the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-R">-R flag</A>.
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_HINTS<DD>
Additional repositories which may have been consulted in order to find
the master copy of the parent directory.  This is the combination of
the argument to the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-h">-h flag</A> (if it was used) and the hints
from the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#Configuration"><I>[UserInterface]DefaultHints</I>
configuration setting</A> (if set in the configuration file).
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_REMOTE<DD>
Set to 1 if the parent directory of the directory created by
<B>vmkdir</B> is mastered in a remote repository, set to 0 otherwise.
If this is set to 1, the directory will be created in the remote
master ($VESTA_MASTER_REPOS) and replicated to the local repository
($VESTA_REPOS).
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_REPOS<DD>
The repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) with mastership of the
parent directory of the directory created by <B>vmkdir</B>.  If this is
different from $VESTA_REPOS, $VESTA_MASTER_REMOTE will be set to 1 and
the directory is created at the remote master repository.
<DT>VESTA_DIR<DD>
The directory created by <B>vmkdir</B>.
<DT>VESTA_ACQUIRE_MASTERSHIP<DD>
Set to 1 if <B>vmkdir</B> is creating a directory at a remote master
repository and acquiring mastership of it in the local repository, set
to 0 otherwise.  (If $VESTA_REPOS is the same as $VESTA_MASTER_REPOS
this will be 0.)  See <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-aA">the description of the -a/-A flags
above</A>.
<DT>VESTA_PACKAGE_PARENT<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-p">the -p flag was given</A> and the directory is
being created under <TT>/vesta</TT>, set to 0 otherwise.  (This will be 0
if the directory being created is under <TT>/vesta-work</TT>, even if the
-p flag was given.)
<DT>VESTA_QUIET<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-q">the quiet flag (-q) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
<DT>VESTA_FORCE<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-f">the force flag (-f) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
</DL>
<P>

(Note that the environment variables are the same for both the pre and
post trigger commands.)<P>

Here are some examples using these environment variables:
<PRE>
[vmkdir pre trigger]
// If the user tries to create a directory with type package-parent
// directly below /vesta, cause vmkdir to fail
50no_toplevel_pp = if [ "`dirname $VESTA_DIR`" = "/vesta" -a $VESTA_PACKAGE_PARENT -eq 1 ]; then exit 1; fi

[vmkdir post trigger]
// Add an attribute when a directory is created remotely and has local
// mastership acquired
50made_remote = [ $VESTA_ACQUIRE_MASTERSHIP -eq 0 ] || vattrib -R $VESTA_REPOS -s "created-at" $VESTA_MASTER_REPOS $VESTA_DIR
</PRE>

If the <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag (-v)</A> is given, these
environment variables will be printed, and each trigger command will
be printed before executing it.  This can be useful for debugging
trigger problems.  If both <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag</A> and the
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> are given, the triggers are displayed
in their sorted order without actually running them.  This can be used
to find out what trigger commands are configured without actually
running them.

<B>vmkdir</B> is atomic if it modifies only the local
repository.  If a remote repository must be modified, however, the
action performed at each repository is individually atomic, but
<B>vmkdir</B> can die between the actions on the remote and local
repositories.  To make this problem less likely to occur, <B>vmkdir</B>
ignores <TT>SIGINT</TT> (the ^C interrupt) during the critical section.
