<I>VestaWeed</I> is the Vesta-2 weeder. It reads the instructions file
<I>root-file</I>, which specifies a set of package builds to be kept, as
described in the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#InputSect">Input File Format</A> section below.
Any cache entries and derived files that participated in those builds
are kept, and all others are deleted.
<I>VestaWeed</I> runs in parallel with the Vesta-2 function cache server
<A HREF="VCache.1.html">VCache(1)</A>, so new builds can be performed while
the weeder is running.<P>

Weeding has two phases. The <I>mark</I> phase marks all cache entries
and derived files that are reachable from any of the <I>root</I> package
builds specified in <I>root-file</I>.  During the subsequent
<I>deletion</I> phase, any unmarked cache entries and derived files are
deleted.<P>

Depending on the number of packages that have been built and the size
of the repository being used, a weed may take quite a long time to
run.  Further, once the mark phase is finished, the weed must run to
completion before a new weed can be started with a different
instructions file.  Therefore, when the mark phase finishes, the
weeder writes its state to stable storage so that it can resume after
a crash.  The next time the weeder is run after a crash, it will
resume the deletion phase where it left off and complete it before
beginning a new weed.  To complete a previous weed without starting
a new one, run <I>VestaWeed</I> without specifying a <I>root-file</I>.
To check whether an incomplete weed exists without completing it,
run <I>VestaWeed</I> with the -nodelete flag and without a <I>root-file</I>.<P>

It is a fatal error to run two weeds simultaneously. If you do, you'll
receive the following error message, and the weed will be aborted:
<PRE>
  Fatal error: another weed is already in progress!
</PRE>

<I>VestaWeed</I> requires that both a function cache and repository are
running. Since <I>VestaWeed</I> requires root access to the repository,
it must be run as the Vesta administrator.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="StepsSect">Step-by-Step Instructions</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

To run the weeder, you should follow these steps:<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Create a file of weeder instructions for the weeder to read. The
instructions file has the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#InputSect">file format</A> described
below. As an example, here is the file currently used by the Vesta
developers:
<PRE>
  # VestaWeed(1) instruction file for keeping:
  #  - last main version of each package
  #  - last main version of each package branch
  #  - last version of each checkout session
  #  - last version of each private checkout session
  #  - last version of each checkout session of each branch

  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/LAST/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/*.*/LAST/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/checkout/LAST/LAST/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/checkout/LAST.*/LAST/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/*.*/checkout/LAST/LAST/.main.ves
</PRE>

You will need to modify these instructions to suit your particular
package organization, and to keep the package builds that you consider
important.<P>

<LI>
su to the Vesta administrator account. VestaWeed must be run as the
Vesta administrator!<P>

<LI>
Run the weeder using the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#QOption">-query</A> option to have the weeder
prompt you before actually doing any deletions. For example, if your
<I>root-file</I> instructions file is named <TT>weed-pkgs.txt</TT>, you
could run:
<PRE>
  % VestaWeed -q -m -r -keep 2d -debug All weed-pkgs.txt
</PRE>

The <I><A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#KeepOption">-keep 2d</A></I> option instructs the weeder to
keep any builds performed within the past 2 days. The other
<A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#OptionsSect">options</A> are described below. Be sure to
scrutinize the output produced by the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#ROption">-roots</A> option to
make sure that everything that you expect to be kept has a disposition
of either "+" or "&gt;".<P>

<LI>
If you are satisfied with the output from the previous step, answer
the weeder's query in the affirmative to tell it to perform the
deletions.
</OL>
<P>

More examples of weeder use are described in the
<A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#ExampleSect">Examples</A> section below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="OptionsSect">Options</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The weeder recognizes the following command-line options. All options
can be abbreviated to a single letter.<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="NOption"><B>-nodelete</B></A><DD>
Do not actually delete any cache entries or derived files. This option
is intended to be used with the <B>-models</B>, <B>-roots</B>, and/or <B>-debug</B>
options below to determine which package builds will be kept and which
will not. This option is mutually exclusive with <B>-query</B>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="QOption"><B>-query</B></A><DD>
Query the user before proceeding to the weeder's deletion phase. This option
is intended to be used with the <B>-models</B>, <B>-roots</B>, and/or <B>-debug</B>
options below to determine which package builds will be kept and which
will not. If the results from the mark phase are satisfactory, type
"yes" to continue the weeding process. This option is mutually
exclusive with <B>-nodelete</B>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="MOption"><B>-models</B></A><DD>
As described in the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#InputSect">Input File Format</A> section
below, the <I>root-file</I> contains <I>model patterns</I>, each of which
matches a <I>set</I> of model files in the Vesta repository. The <B>-models</B>
option prints the names of all the actual model files matched by each
of the patterns.<P>

<DT><A NAME="ROption"><B>-roots</B></A><DD>
For each package built against the function cache, this option prints an
indication as to whether or not that package will be treated as a root
of the weed or not. This option is useful for determining exactly
which builds will be kept and which will be deleted according to the
<I>root-file</I>. Since the processing for this option requires scanning the
entire repository, it can take a while to run.<P>

For each different package build found in the function cache's graph
log, this option prints the name of the package build (i.e., the full
pathname of the evaluated model) preceded by a single character
indicating its disposition:<P>

<DL>
<DT>"<TT>+</TT>"<DD>
indicates that the <I>root-file</I> specifies the package
should be kept;
<DT>"<TT>&gt;</TT>"<DD>
indicates that the <I>root-file</I> does <I>not</I> specify
that the package should be kept, but the package will be kept because
it is new enough according the specified <B>-keep</B> value, as
described below; and
<DT>"<TT>-</TT>"<DD>
indicates that the package will not be kept.
</DL>
<P>

In some cases, a full pathname is not printed. Instead, lines like
the following may be printed:
<PRE>
  - /vesta/src.dec.com/test2/test/checkout/3/17; modelShortId = 0xa178760d
</PRE>

<PRE>
  - pkgDirFP = 79325c4a7da511f8 a64f3b1646bdb47b; modelShortId = 0xa178760d
</PRE>

The first line indicates the disposition of the evaluation of the
model with the specified shortid residing in the named directory.
This sort of line is usually caused by the fact that the evaluated
model did not end with a "<I>.ves</I>" extension. In this case,
you can use "ls -li" in the named directory to see the shortids
(in decimal) of the files in that directory. Unless the model
has since been deleted, one of the listed shortids will match
the one printed by VestaWeed.<P>

The second line indicates the disposition of the evaluation of the
model with the specified shortid residing in the immutable directory
with the specified 128-bit fingerprint. This degenerate output is
printed as a last resort when not even the directory of the evaluated
model could be found. It is most likely caused by the fact that the
model in question (and the directory in which it was contained) have
been deleted.<P>

<DT><A NAME="KeepOption"><B>-keep</B> <I>dur</I></A><DD>
Specifies that the weeder should keep any package build performed less
than <I>dur</I> hours ago, regardless of whether the <I>root-file</I>
says that it should be kept. If <B>-keep</B> is not specified,
<I>dur</I> defaults to 0.<P>

By default, the duration <I>dur</I> specifies a time interval in hours.
Different time units may be specified by adding a trailing letter to
specify other units: "d" for days, "h" for hours, and "m" for
minutes. For example, "-keep 2d" specifies a keep interval of two
days.<P>

<DT><A NAME="DebugOption"><B>-debug</B> <I>level</I></A><DD>
By default, no debugging information is printed. However, the weeder
has support for printing various kinds of debugging information. This
debugging output is categorized into various levels. All levels at and
below the specified <I>level</I> will be printed. The values of
<I>level</I> that are relevant to the weeder (in increasing order) are:<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>None</I><DD>
Don't print any debugging information. This is the default.<P>

<DT><I>StatusMsgs</I><DD>
Print weeder status messages.<P>

<DT><I>LogRecover</I><DD>
Print a description of data recovered from the weeder's logs at
start-up.<P>

<DT><I>LogFlush</I><DD>
Print a description of data written to the weeder's logs when
they are flushed.<P>

<DT><I>WeederOps</I><DD>
Print the arguments and results of all weeder calls  to the cache
server.<P>

<DT><I>WeederScans</I><DD>
Print a message each time the graph log (or intermediate
representation of the graph log) is scanned.<P>

<DT><I>All</I><DD>
Print all debugging information. This is equivalent to <I>WeederScans</I>.
</DL>
<P>

Debugging output is grouped into logical <I>entries</I>. Each debugging
output entry includes a timestamp.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="InputSect">Input File Format</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This section describes the format of the input <I>root-file</I>. The
<I>root-file</I> consists of a series of <I>model patterns</I>, each
separated by a newline. Comments and blank lines are also allowed. A
comment is any line starting with a pound character "<TT>#</TT>"; all
characters from the start of the line up to and including the first
newline are ignored.<P>

Each model pattern is the character "<TT>+</TT>" or "<TT>-</TT>" followed
by a pathname. The pathname specifies a set of models. The set of
models to be used as roots of the weed is built up incrementally.
Model patterns that start with "<TT>+</TT>" are added to the current set
of roots to keep, while model patterns that start with "<TT>-</TT>" are
removed from the set. In this way, selectively smaller subsets may be
alternatingly added and removed from the final set of roots. After all
of the patterns have been processed, the remaining set of models are
the ones that will be treated as roots of the weed.<P>

The pathname portion of a model pattern may contain the familiar
meta-characters recognized by the shell globbing mechanism. These
include:<P>

<DL>
<DT>*<DD>
Match zero or more characters.<P>

<DT>?<DD>
Match a single character.<P>

<DT>[<I>chars</I>]<DD>
Match one of the characters listed in <I>chars</I>.<P>

<DT>{<I>x_1</I>,<I>x_2</I>,<I>...</I>,<I>x_n</I>}<DD>
Match any of the strings <I>x_i</I>. Nested meta-characters
within such patterns are not supported.
</DL>
<P>

In addition to these patterns, the following special patterns
are also recognized in model patterns:<P>

<DL>
<DT>FIRST<DD>
Matches the name in the specified directory consisting entirely of
decimal digits (with no leading zeroes) and with the smallest numerical
value.<P>

<DT>LAST<DD>
Matches the name in the specified directory consisting entirely of
decimal digits (with no leading zeroes) and with the largest numerical
value.<P>

<DT>[<I>exprLow</I>,<I>exprHigh</I>]<DD>
Here, both <I>exprLow</I> and <I>exprHigh</I> are integer-valued expressions.
This matches any name in the specified directory consisting entirely of
decimal digits (with no leading zeroes) whose value is in the closed
interval <I>[low,high]</I>, where <I>low</I> and <I>high</I> are the values of
the expressions <I>exprLow</I> and <I>exprHigh</I>, respectively. If 
<I>high &lt; low</I>, then the interval is empty. Each expression in an
interval pattern may be of the form "<I>expr</I> - <I>expr</I>" or
"<I>expr</I> + <I>expr</I>", where each <I>expr</I> is either a decimal
number, one of the special patterns <TT>FIRST</TT> or <TT>LAST</TT>
described above, or an <I>expr</I>.
</DL>
<P>

Note: The traditional square-bracket metasymbols to match one of a set
of characters can still be used, even though square brackets are also used
to represent integer-valued intervals. The two cases can be
disambiguated by the appearance or absence of a comma. To specify a
set of characters that includes a comma, you must include the comma as
either the first or the last character of the set.<P>

Each model pattern is matched against the contents of the filesystem
on which <I>VestaWeed</I> is run. If the pattern contains any of the
meta-symbols described above, it may match several different model
files. If the <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html#MOption"><B>-models</B></A> option is specified, the full
pathname of each model file so matched is written to the standard
output.<P>

Technical point: File and directory names in the file system that begin
with dot are not matched by any meta-symbols.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="DiagnosticsSect">Diagnostics</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

If the weeder fails, it prints out a diagnostic error message. These
error messages are meant to be self-explanatory.<P>

The error message:
<PRE>
  Repository error: noPermission (code = 2)
    Failing operation: VestaSource::list
  Exiting...
</PRE>

indicates that the weeder got a permission-denied error accessing the
repository. This error can be avoided by running VestaWeed from the
Vesta administrator account.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ExampleSect">Examples</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Here are some examples of various weeder instructions and subsequent
runs of the weeder:<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Example 1</B><P>

<DD><PRE>
+ /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/*/LAST/.main.ves
</PRE>

This <I>root-file</I> specifies that only the last main build of each
vesta package should be kept. Here is a sample run of the program
using this file:
<PRE>
$ VestaWeed -n -r -keep 1h last-main.txt
Disposition of GraphLog roots:
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/release/13/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/srpc/6/.main.ves
  + /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/log/7/.main.ves
  - /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/log/5/.main.ves
  - /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/srpc/5/.main.ves
  &gt; /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/basics/24/.main.ves
</PRE>

Notice that the "vesta/basics/24" package is only
kept because it was built less than one hour ago.<P>

<DT><B>Example 2</B><P>

<DD><PRE>
+ /vesta/src.dec.com/{common,vesta}/*/[LAST-4,LAST]/.main.ves
+ /vesta/src.dec.com/{common,vesta}/*/checkout/LAST/*/.main.ves
</PRE>

This <I>root-file</I> specifies that the last 5 builds of every package in
the "common" and "vesta" portions of the repository should be
kept, and that all of the builds in the last checkout session of those
packages should also be kept.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, the weeder reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. The weeder first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The weeder uses variables
in the <TT>[CacheServer]</TT> and <TT>[Weeder]</TT> sections of the
configuration file. Here are the variables and their meanings; the
types of the variables are shown in parentheses. Those variables
corresponding to paths or directories should <I>not</I> end with a slash
("/") character.<P>

The following variables are read from the <TT>[CacheServer]</TT> section
of the configuration file:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>Host</TT> (string)<DD>
The name of the machine on which the cache server is running.<P>

<DT><TT>Port</TT> (string)<DD>
The port on the above machine to contact for RPC connections.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
Other configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>GraphLogDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which
the cache server stores its graph log, which is read by the weeder.
</DL>
<P>

The following variables are read from the <TT>[Weeder]</TT> section of the
configuration file:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the $MetaDataRoot) in which the weeder's
metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>Weeded</TT>, <TT>MiscVars</TT> (strings)<DD>
The files (relative to $MetaDataRoot/$MetaDataDir)
corresponding to stable weeder variables.<P>

<DT><TT>PendingGL</TT>, <TT>WorkingGL</TT> (strings)<DD>
The names of the cache server's "pending" and "working"
graphLog files. The files are stored in $MetaDataRoot/$MetaDataDir.<P>

<DT><TT>GLNodeBuffSize</TT> (integer)<DD>
This is the maximum number of graph log nodes the weeder keeps
buffered in memory when it processes the graph log. The larger the
number, the more memory required by the weeder, but the fewer times
the weeder will have to scan the graph log during its mark phase.<P>

<DT><TT>DIBuffSize</TT> (integer)<DD>
This is the maximum number of derived indices the weeder keeps
buffered in memory to avoiding writing duplicate derived indices to
the "derived keep file" to be read by the repository.<P>

<DT><TT>GracePeriod</TT> (integer)<DD>
This optional setting specifies an amount of time (in seconds) to
subtract from the weeder start time.  Any files in the repository
(source or derived) changed after that time will be kept during
weeding.  This closes a small hole which can allow files written by
long-running tools that finish close to when the weeder starts to be
deleted incorrectly.  An ideal setting would be the duration of the
longest running tool.  Defaults to 60 seconds if not set.  Ignored if
set to a negative value.
</DL>
<P>

The following variables are also read from the <TT>[Weeder]</TT> section
of the configuration file. They are used to prevent weeds against local
caches. They specify the location of the centralized cache server, and
should not be overridden by local configuration files. If you try to
run the weeder against a local cache, you will get an error message
and the weed will not proceed. Check your configuration file to be sure
that it is selecting the centralized cache at your site.<P>
