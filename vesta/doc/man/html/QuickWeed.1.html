<I>QuickWeed</I> is a fast but conservative weeder for Vesta-2.
As opposed to the real weeder <A HREF="http://www.vestasys.org/doc/man/html/VestaWeed.1.mtex">VestaWeed(1)</A>,
<I>QuickWeed</I> treats <I>every</I> entry in the cache
as a root of its mark phase. Hence, every cache entry is retained.
The only files deleted are those that are not mentioned 
as deriveds in any cache entry and not mentioned as sources in
any directory in the repository.<P>

Normally, <I>QuickWeed</I> cannot be run if there is an incomplete
<I>VestaWeed</I> in progress.  In particular, if <I>VestaWeed</I> (or the
cache) crashes before it has finished, you must run <I>VestaWeed</I>
again to finish the old weed and clean up its state before a new weed
can be started by either <I>QuickWeed</I> or <I>VestaWeed</I>.
<I>QuickWeed</I> will exit with an informative message if it detects
that another <I>VestaWeed</I> or <I>QuickWeed</I> is in progress.<P>

<I>QuickWeed</I> also has a special mode for use with a repository that
has no associated cache (e.g. one used for replication but never for
building).  If both <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#iOpt"><B>-i</B></A> and
<A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#noCacheOpt"><B>-no-cache</B></A> are specified, <I>QuickWeed</I> will
cause the repository to do its part of the weeding process but keeps
no derived files.  This should only be used if there is no cache
associated with the repository, as it invalidates any such cache.<P>

Since <I>QuickWeed</I> must write a file into the Vesta repository
specifying which deriveds to keep, it must be run as the Vesta administrator.
This requirement does not apply if the <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#nOpt"><B>-n</B></A> option
is being used.

<H3><A NAME="OptionsSect">Options</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="nOpt"><B>-n</B></A><DD>
If the <B>-n</B> option is specified, <I>QuickWeed</I> computes the
short-ID's of the derived files to be kept and writes them to the
standard output, but it does not actually do the work of weeding
any source or derived files.  Also implies the <B>-p</B> option.<P>

<DT><A NAME="pOpt"><B>-p</B></A><DD>
Suppresses checkpointing the repository.  By default, <I>QuickWeed</I>
tells the repository to checkpoint itself after the weed is complete,
which compacts the repository's memory and
speeds up recovery the next time the repository is restarted.<P>

<DT><A NAME="cfOpt"><B>-cf</B> <I>config-file</I></A><DD>
The <B>-cf</B> option can be specified any number of times. Each
instance names a new configuration file to be consulted. If
<I>config-file</I> is a pathname ending in "/", the filename
"<TT>vesta.cfg</TT>" is automatically appended.
For each additional configuration file consulted, <I>QuickWeed</I>
contacts the cache server named in the configuration file and records
the names of the derived files in that cache server's graph log.
Thus, all the derived files in all the named caches are protected from
deletion.<P>

Specifying more than one cache to <I>QuickWeed</I> is useful only in the very
unusual situation that multiple caches are being used with the same
repository.  This is not ordinarily done, and in fact, <I>VestaWeed</I> does
not support it.  <I>QuickWeed</I> supports multiple caches only for
historical reasons; the feature was useful when the cache server was
first being implemented and debugged.<P>

<DT><A NAME="iOpt"><B>-i</B></A><DD>
Ignores the default configuration file. By default, <I>QuickWeed</I>
determines the deriveds to retain by contacting the cache named in the
user's Vesta configuration file. When <B>-i</B> is specified, the
user's configuration file is ignored. The program reports an error if
<B>-i</B> is specified without <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#cfOpt"><B>-cf</B></A>, unless
<A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#noCacheOpt"><B>-no-cache</B></A> is also sepcified.<P>

<DT><A NAME="noCacheOpt"><B>-no-cache</B></A><DD>
Allows all caches to be ignored completely.  In other words, it
enables performing the repository's part of the weeding process but
keeps no derived files.  This is intended for use with repositories
that do not have associated caches (e.g. ones used for replication but
never for building).  Both <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#iOpt"><B>-i</B></A> and <B>-no-cache</B>
must be specified together to activate this feature.  The program
reports an error if <B>-no-cache</B> is specified without
<A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#iOpt"><B>-i</B></A> or with <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#cfOpt"><B>-cf</B></A>.

<I>QuickWeed</I> prints diagnostic messages to the standard error
output. It prints the start and end times of each
graph log scan, the derived weed, and the deletion phase.
(The repository performs source weeding together with the deletion phase;
see its event log for the messages it prints.)
<I>QuickWeed</I> also prints the names of the
configuration files consulted, the host and port of the corresponding
cache server, the number of graph log entries
processed, and the total number of derived files named in those entries.
(The latter figure may double-count if the same derived file is named in
more than one graph log entry).

<DL>
<DT><TT>$ QuickWeed -n &gt; /tmp/deriveds</TT><DD>
Runs <I>QuickWeed</I>, but doesn't do any deletions.
The list of deriveds to keep is saved in the named file. The following
output appears on the standard error output:
<PRE>
09:48:13.156 -- Started graph log scan
  Configuration file: /tmp_mnt/shellgame/r/dlusers9/heydon/vesta.cfg
  Hostname:port: rafael.pa.dec.com:21763
  Graph log: /rafael/vesta-srv/cache/graphLog
09:48:13.460 -- Finished graph log scan
  Graph log entries processed = 1114
  Derived files found = 2293
</PRE>

<DT><TT>$ QuickWeed</TT><DD>
Same as above, only this time, the source and derived weeds do occur.
Here is the output from this run:
<PRE>

<H3><A NAME="ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, the cache server reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. <I>QuickWeed</I> first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory. The <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#iOpt"><B>-i</B></A> option disables consultation of
the default configuration file, and the <A HREF="QuickWeed.1.html#cfOpt"><B>-cf</B></A> option
allows you to specify other configuration files.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. <I>QuickWeed</I> determines
which derived files to keep by reading the cache server's graph log.
The following variables in the <TT>[CacheServer]</TT> section of the
configuration file are read to determine the location of this file:<P>

<DL>

<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
Other configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>GraphLogDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which
the cache server stores its graph log.
</DL>
<P>

There are also some variables used from the <TT>[Weeder]</TT> section of
the configuration file:<P>

<DL>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to <TT>[CacheServer]MetaDataRoot</TT>) in which
the weeder's metadata is stored.<P>

<DT><TT>Weeded</TT> (string)<DD>
The file (relative to
<TT>[CacheServer]MetaDataRoot</TT>/<TT>[Weeder]MetaDataDir</TT>) in which the
set of cache entries to be deleted by the normal weeder
(<I>VestaWeed</I>) is stored.  QuickWeed checks this as a precaution to
make sure that the normal weeder isn't in the middle of doing its
work.<P>

<DT><TT>GracePeriod</TT> (integer)<DD>
This optional setting specifies an amount of time (in seconds) to
subtract from the weeder start time.  Any files in the repository
(source or derived) changed after that time will be kept during
weeding.  This closes a small hole which can allow files written by
long-running tools that finish close to when the weeder starts to be
deleted incorrectly.  An ideal setting would be the duration of the
longest running tool.  Defaults to 60 seconds if not set.  Ignored if
set to a negative value.
