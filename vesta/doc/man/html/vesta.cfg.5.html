Most Vesta tools use a standard mechanism for
determining configuration information about a Vesta installation.
This mechanism attempts to locate a configuration file named
<I>vesta.cfg</I> by searching in a number of locations. The 
<A HREF="vgetconfig.1.html"><B>vgetconfig</B>(1)</A> man page
describes a command-line interface for determining the location of the
configuration file and for printing the value of a particular
configuration variable. The meanings of the configuration variables
recognized by the various tools are documented in their individual man
pages.

<H3><A NAME="Locations">Locating the Configuration File</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The Vesta tools search for the <I>vesta.cfg</I> file in the following
locations:<P>

<OL>
<LI>
The file named by the VESTACONFIG environment variable is used if that
environment variable is defined and the file exists.
<LI>
Otherwise, the <I>vesta.cfg</I> file in the directory named by the HOME
environment variable is used if that environment variable is defined
and the file exists.
<LI>
Otherwise, <I>/etc/vesta.cfg</I> is used if it exists.
</OL>
<P>

If all of these search locations fail, the Vesta tools that require
the configuration file will print an error message and exit.<P>

A few tools (such as vgetconfig and QuickWeed) take command line paramaters
to override the location of configuration files.

Here is a EBNF grammar for Vesta configuration files.
<PRE>
  config-file  ::= ws section ws new-line line*
  line         ::= ws ( section | option | comment ) ws new-line
  section      ::= '[' ws name ws ']' 
		 | '[' "include" ws name ws ']'
  option       ::= name ws '=' ws value
  comment      ::= ( ';' | "//" ) non-new-line* | &lt;empty&gt;
  name         ::= ( letter | digit | special )+
  value        ::= non-new-line*
  new-line     ::= &lt;ASCII CR&gt; | &lt;ASCII LF&gt;
  non-new-line ::= &lt;any ASCII character except those for new-line&gt;
  ws           ::= &lt;space&gt; | &lt;tab&gt;
</PRE>

This grammar is slightly ambiguous, but the intent should be clear.
The file is a sequence of lines, each of which is either a section name
in square brackets, a &lt;name,value&gt; pair separated by an equal sign, or
a comment.  Leading and trailing white space is ignored, as are blank
lines and comment lines.  A comment line has a semicolon or two slashes
as its first non-whitespace characters.<P>

The configuration file defines a two-level naming structure, with
sections as the upper level and the names of &lt;name, value&gt; pairs as the
lower level.  Once the file has been parsed, the basic operation is
to lookup a &lt;section, name&gt; pair, obtaining the associated value.
See the <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html#Example">example configuration file</A> below.<P>

There is a facility for one configuration file to refer to other
ones.  Notice the second alternative for the <I>section</I> nonterminal
in the grammar above.  When this form is used, it doesn't introduce
a section name; instead, if <I>name</I> specifies a file, it is read and processed.
That is, if a file contains a line of the form:
<PRE>
  [include /proj/vesta/pkg/config-file/vesta.cfg]
</PRE>

then the line will effectively be replaced by the sections contained in
the file <TT>/proj/vesta/pkg/config-file/vesta.cfg</TT>. If instead, <I>name</I>
specifies a directory, all of the files in it and any sub-directories are
read and processed.  The file names are sorted as strings, but comparing
embedded sequences of digits as decimal integers.  (So, for example "foo_10_bar" will
sort after "foo_2_bar".)  Files in sub-directories are sorted first by the
name of the sub-directory itself and then within the sub-directory by file name.<P>

All options must be in a section.  Any file (included or the main file)
must have a named section before any options.  See the example below.<P>

This mechanism is chiefly intended for overriding a set of shared
defaults.  A configuration file containing standard definitions is
stored in a public location (usually /etc/vesta.cfg).  A second
configuration file is stored in the user's home directory or at the
location specified by the environment variable VESTACONFIG.  This
second file begins with an <I>include</I> line that mentions the first
file, then continues with additional sections that either add to or
override the standard definitions.  Thus, it is not an error for a
&lt;section, name&gt; pair to appear more than once in the course of
configuration file processing (which may involve reading multiple
files).  The value encountered last wins.

<P>

Here is a sample configuration file. This file includes a central
configuration file, and then overrides some configuration variables
in the <I>Evaluator</I> and <I>Run_Tool</I> sections.
<PRE>
  // Include standard configuration file
  [include /etc/vesta.cfg]
  
  // ----------------------------------------------
  [Evaluator]
  
  // always print a stack trace on runtime errors
  Switches = -stack
  
  // host to use for DU4.0 builds
  DU4.0 = rowdy.pa.dec.com
  
  // ----------------------------------------------
  [Run_Tool]
  
  // print RunToolServer debugging info
  helper_switches = -d
</PRE>
