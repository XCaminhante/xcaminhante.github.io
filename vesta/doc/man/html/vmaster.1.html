See the
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section of the
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page for definitions of
terms.<P>

The <B>vmaster</B> command tells the destination (-d) repository to
acquire mastership of the specified objects from the source (-s)
repository.  
By default, the local repository is taken as the
destination and the source repository is guessed; see below for details.
The objects must be specified by their full global pathnames (that is, by
names beginning with "/vesta").
The objects must already exist in the destination repository;
use the Vesta replicator
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html">vrepl</A> first if they do not.
If the destination repository already has mastership, the command
has no effect; this is not considered an error.<P>

For mastership transfer on an object to be allowed, the user must have
ownership permission in both the source and destination repositories.
The source repository must be willing to cede mastership to the
destination repository, and the destination repository must be willing
to accept mastership from the source repository.  A repository is
willing to cede (or accept) mastership on an object from another
repository if, when searching upward from the object's pathname in its
copy of the namespace, the first object it finds that has a
<TT>#mastership-to</TT> (or respectively <TT>#mastership-from</TT>) attribute
includes the other repository's host:port name (or '<TT>*</TT>') in its
value.  If no object with the appropriate attribute is found,
permission is denied.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-r">-r</A><DD>
Recursively acquire mastership on all children of the specified
objects, as well as the objects themselves.
Default: off.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-s">-s</A> <I>srchost</I>[:[<I>srcport</I>][:<I>srcuser</I>]]<DD>
Specifies the source repository by host name and TCP port number.  If
not specified, vmaster tries to guess the correct
source repository, by looking for "master-repository" attributes on
the specified objects or their ancestor directories.  If <I>srchost</I> is
specified but <I>srcport</I> is omitted, <I>srcport</I> defaults to the local
repository's port number as specified in the active Vesta
configuration file (see the <A HREF="vmaster.1.html#Configuration">Configuration</A>
section below).  Alternatively, the string "local" can be given to
explicitly specify the local repository.<P>

You can also specify the global user name under which you will access
the source repository.  The default is <I>user</I>@<I>realm</I>, where
<I>user</I> is your local user name and <I>realm</I> is the value of
[UserInterface]realm in the active Vesta configuration file.
If vrepl cannot authenticate you to the source repository as 
being the specified user, the transfer will fail with an error message.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-d">-d</A> <I>dsthost</I>[:[<I>dstport</I>][:<I>dstuser</I>]]<DD>
Specifies the destination repository by host name and TCP port number.
Both <I>dsthost</I> and <I>dstport</I>
default to the values specified for the local
repository in the active Vesta configuration file (see the 
<A HREF="vmaster.1.html#Configuration">Configuration</A> section below).  Alternatively, the string
"local" can be given to explicitly specify the local repository.<P>

You can also specify the global user name under which you will access
the destination repository.  The default is <I>user</I>@<I>realm</I>, where
<I>user</I> is your local user name and <I>realm</I> is the value of
[UserInterface]realm in the active Vesta configuration file.
If vrepl cannot authenticate you to the destination repository as 
being the specified user, the transfer will fail with an error message.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-h">-h</A> <I>hints</I><DD>
If you do not give the -s flag to specify the source repository
explicitly, and <B>vmaster</B> fails to guess it,
you can suggest additional repositories to look in using this option.
The <I>hints</I> argument is a comma- or space-separated list of repositories,
specified by host name and TCP port number 
in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it
defaults to <A HREF="vmaster.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.<P>

<P>

Here are the most common error messages you are likely to see and what they
generally mean.<P>

<I>Can't find master replica</I>: The algorithm for guessing the
appropriate source repository failed.  The object's name and a list of
repositories that were unsuccessfully tried follows on the same line.
You can correct the problem by either explicitly specifying the source
repository with the -s flag, supplying additional hints with the -h
flag, or correcting the object's <TT>master-repository</TT> attribute in
the destination repository.<P>

<I>Invalid argument</I>: Returned for implementation errors where one of
the two repositories supplies invalid data to the other; these should
never occur.<P>

<I>Name too long</I>: Overly long arc in pathname.<P>

<I>No permission</I>: Permission to change either the destination
or source repository was denied.<P>

<I>Not a directory</I>: Invalid pathname that has arcs beyond a leaf.<P>

<I>Not found</I>: The object was not found in the destination repository.
You may need to use the Vesta replicator
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html">vrepl</A> first to copy it in.<P>

<I>Not master replica</I>: The specified source repository
is not the master for this object.  This includes the case where the
source repository does not have a copy of the object (or a stub
or ghost).<P>

<I>Operation not available on given source type</I>: Mastership transfer
is not permitted between the specified object types.  The forbidden
types of transfer are:
<UL>
<LI> To a stub from a non-stub.
<LI> To an appendable directory from a ghost.
<LI> To a ghost from a non-ghost.  (Technically legal,
but disallowed because it probably represents a mistake.)
<LI> On an object
that does not have independent mastership (e.g., a file in an
immutable directory).
<LI> Between types that should not occur together
because they violate the replica agreement invariant (e.g., to an immutable
directory from a file).
</UL>
<P>

<I>Remote call from repository to another server failed</I>:
A remote procedure call from destination to source repository failed.
One of the following two messages will normally appear on the next line:
<UL>
<LI> <I>Note: transfer was not started</I>: The error occurred before the 
transfer protocol got under way.  Neither repository was modified.
<LI> <I>Note: transfer is still in progress; may finish later</I>: The error
occurred after the transfer was partially done.  The destination
object is left with a "#master-request" attribute set, and the
destination repository has forked a recovery thread to complete 
or abort the transfer.  This thread runs periodically, persisting even after
reboots, until the source repository can be contacted to resolve the
transfer.  If necessary, you can force the destination to give up on recovery
by manually removing the "#master-request" attribute, but this may leave
the object with no master replica, and/or leave a dangling "#master-grant" 
attribute on the source replica.
</UL>
<P>

<I>SRPC failure</I>: The remote procedure call from <B>vmaster</B> to the
destination repository failed.  More information about the failure
follows on the same line, and if it is possible that the call was
started, the message "<I>Note: transfer might have been started</I>"
appears on the next line.  If the transfer was in fact started, it may
either have finished successfully, have been aborted, or be still in progress
as described above.

<P>

As with all Vesta tools, $VESTACONFIG can be used to override the
default location for the Vesta configuration file.  No other
environment variables are used.

<H3><A NAME="Configuration">Configuration</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the Vesta configuration file
(vesta.cfg).<P>

From the <TT>[Repository]</TT> section:
<DL>
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_host</I><DD>
Host name of the default local repository.
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_port</I><DD>
TCP port number of the default local repository.
</DL>
<P>

From the <TT>[UserInterface]</TT> section:
<DL>
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Name of the local realm.  <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> is appended to local user names
to obtain global user names.
</DL>
<P>

!! It might be nice to optionally call the replicator for the
specified objects (but not their children) first.  -r should
probably not make this recursive, but maybe a stronger (-R?) flag should
be available to do so.  What about all the flags the replicator
can take, though?<P>

!! When/if GSS-API authentication is added, your credentials for the
source repository will have to be delegatable to the destination
repository.
