</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Description</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The Vesta-2 cache server <A HREF="VCache.1.html">VCache(1)</A>
keeps a stable log of new cache entries called the <I>cache log</I> that
have yet to be written to stable cache entry files. It also keeps a
stable log of PKFiles that have been deleted called the <I>empty PK
log</I>. This program prints an ASCII representation of both logs to
standard output.<P>

The empty PK log is a sequence of <I>(pk, pkEpoch)</I> pairs, where
<I>pk</I> is the primary key identifying the deleted PKFile (a
fingerprint), and <I>pkEpoch</I> is the epoch the PKFile would have had
if it had not been deleted. For a description of this log and why it
is needed, see the description on
<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#CacheLog">supporting deletions in the
CacheLog</A>. <P>

The cache log is a sequence of <I>(pk, pkEpoch, entry)</I> triples,
where <I>pk</I> is the primary key of the entry (a fingerprint),
<I>pkEpoch</I> is the epoch in effect for its PKFile when it was
created, and <I>entry</I> is the entry itself.<P>

By default, the program writes a one-line summary of each cache log
entry. If <B>-verbose</B> is specified, it writes a complete description
of each one.

<H3>Configuration Variables</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<I>PrintCacheLog</I> locates the cache log file by reading site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. It first looks for this file in the current directory;
if none is found there, it looks in your home directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The variables used by the
<I>PrintCacheLog</I> are in the section denoted by <TT>[CacheServer]</TT>. Here
are the variables it uses and their meanings; the types of the
variables are shown in parentheses:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
If defined, this path should end in a slash (/) character. Other
configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored. This directory should end in a slash (/)
character.<P>

<DT><TT>CacheLogDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot/MetaDataDir) in which
the cache server stores its cache log.
</DL>
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Files</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>$MetaDataRoot/$MetatDataDir/$CacheLogDir/*.log</TT><DD>
CacheLog files. The cache log contains new cache entries that have not
yet been written to stable cache files.
</DL>
