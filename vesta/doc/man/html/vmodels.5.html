<H3><A NAME="IntroSect">Introduction</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This man page is a tutorial for writing Vesta-2 user models to conform
to the existing bridge and standard environment models. In particular,
it documents the <TT>common/std_env/18</TT> and <TT>common/cxx/14</TT>
packages (presumably, this guide will continue to apply to later
versions of those packages as well).<P>

To understand this guide, you will probably want to refer to the
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html">vtypes(5)</A> man page, which describes the data
types used in the common models. To learn about how libraries are
structured and built in Vesta-2, see the
<A HREF="vlibraries.5.html">vlibraries(5)</A> man page. Finally, to build a
model with overrides, refer to the
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html">voverrides(5)</A> man page.

<H3><A NAME="NonLibSect">Non-Library Package Models</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The top-level model of every Vesta-2 package is named
"<TT>build.ves</TT>". This is the model invoked by the control panel's
"<TT>.main.ves</TT>" file.<P>

The <TT>build.ves</TT> model should evaluate to a binding of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#PkgResult"><TT>PkgResult</TT></A>". This binding maps
names to 0-argument closures (not counting the implicit environment
argument) of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#PkgFunc"><TT>PkgFunc</TT></A>".
These functions build libraries and executables exported by the
package.<P>

Most non-library package models build a collection of main programs
executed by the package, and possibly a collection of test programs.
By convention, the corresponding closures are named "<TT>progs</TT>" and
"<TT>tests</TT>". It is often convenient to define each of these closures
by its own model. In that case, the "<TT>build.ves</TT>" model is quite
simple:
<PRE>
import
    progs = progs.ves;
    tests = tests.ves;
{
    return [ progs, tests ];
}
</PRE>

Each of the models <TT>progs.ves</TT> and <TT>tests.ves</TT> lists the files
needed to build the programs, constructs a binding of the library to
link against, optionally defines some overrides for the compilation,
and then invokes the bridge's "<TT>program</TT>" function for each
program. Since "<TT>program</TT>" returns a singleton binding, the result
of the model is formed by simply overlaying the results of each of the
individual "<TT>program</TT>" calls. Here is a typical "<TT>progs.ves</TT>"
model from the <TT>vesta/log</TT> package:
<PRE>
files
    vappendlog = [ vappendlog.C ];
    vdumplog   = [ vdumplog.C ];
{
    // required libraries
    v_libs = ./Cxx/libs/vesta;
    libs = &lt; v_libs/log, v_libs/basics &gt;;

    // overrides
    ovs = [ Cxx/switches/program = [ shared_libs = "-non_shared" ]];

    return
      ./Cxx/program("vappendlog", vappendlog, [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("vdumplog",   vdumplog,   [], libs, ovs);
}
</PRE>

In this case, both programs are built with the same libraries and
overrides. The overrides for linking the program are passed as an
explicit parameter to the <TT>program</TT> function. See the
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html">voverrides(5)</A> man page for details.

<H3><A NAME="LeafLibSect">Leaf Library Package Models</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The current standard models require that a package export at most one
library. If a package builds multiple libraries, they should be
wrapped up into a single umbrella, as <A HREF="vmodels.5.html#UmbLibSect">described
below</A>. In either case, the package's <TT>build.ves</TT> model is required
to evaluate to a binding of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LibPkgResult"><TT>LibPkgResult</TT></A>" that contains a
field named "<TT>lib</TT>". Like a non-library model, a library model may
also export utility programs and test programs. Here is a prototypical
<TT>build.ves</TT> file for a leaf model:
<PRE>
import
    lib = lib.ves;
    progs = progs.ves;
    tests = tests.ves;
{
    return [ lib, progs, tests ];
}
</PRE>

If the package exports a leaf library, its <TT>lib</TT> closure should be
a value of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LibFunc"><TT>LibFunc</TT></A>. In
particular, it should return the result of calling the bridge's
"<TT>leaf</TT>" function. Here is a typical <TT>lib.ves</TT> model, taken from
the <TT>vesta/log</TT> package:
<PRE>
files
    c_files = [Recovery.C, VestaLog.C];
    h_files = [Recovery.H, VestaLog.H, VestaLogPrivate.H];
{
    return ./Cxx/leaf("libVestaLog.a", c_files, h_files);
}
</PRE>

If the library uses some header files that should be hidden from
clients, they can be bound to an optional fourth argument named
"<TT>priv_h_files</TT>" of the bridge's <TT>leaf</TT> function. It is also
possible to specify overrides for the library; see the
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html">voverrides(5)</A> man page for details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="PrebuiltLibSect">Prebuilt Library Package Models</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The models for a prebuilt library (one built outside of Vesta) are
nearly identical to the models for building a leaf library.  The only
difference is in the <TT>lib.ves</TT> model.  Here's an example based on
the <TT>zlib</TT> compression library:
<PRE>
files
    archive = [libz.a];
    headers = [zlib.h, zconf.h];
{
    return ./C/prebuilt("libz.a", headers, archive);
}
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="UmbLibSect">Umbrella Library Package Models</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The models for building an umbrella library are a lot like the models
for building a leaf library, but with two differences.<P>

First, the library must name of all the packages that export libraries 
included in the umbrella. The result of the <TT>build.ves</TT> model must
be a value of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#UmbrellaPkgResult"><TT>UmbrellaPkgResult</TT></A>" that
binds the name "<TT>children</TT>" to the set of child packages. The child
packages themselves are represented by a value of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#QNamedPkgs"><TT>QNamedPkgs</TT></A>". A value of this
type is a two-level binding of <I>qualified</I> package names; each
qualified name is bound to the corresponding package's <TT>build.ves</TT>
model.<P>

Second, the library is constructed by a call to the bridge's
"<TT>umbrella</TT>" function. This function requires the name of the
resulting umbrella library and a list of the libraries in the
umbrella. Each element of the list is a
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LibPkgResult"><TT>LibPkgResult</TT></A>", that is, the
result of evaluating a library package. Typically, the list is formed
by selecting library descriptions out of "<TT>./</TT><I>bridge</I><TT>/libs/</TT>.<P>

As an example, here is the <TT>build.ves</TT> model for the
<TT>vesta/vesta_umb</TT> package:
<PRE>
from /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta import
  vesta_kids = [
      run_tool/4, repos/5, cache/9, fp/1,
      log/4, srpc/4, config/3, basics/22 ];
{
    // closure for dynamically building list of libraries
    lib_models(models: NamedPkgs): LibPkgResults {
      	res = &lt;&gt;;
	foreach [ nm = model ] in models do
            res += &lt; ./Cxx/libs/vesta/$nm &gt;;
      	return res;
    };

    // closure for building umbrella library
    lib(): NamedLibDesc {
        return ./Cxx/umbrella("libVestaUmb.a", lib_models(vesta_kids));
    };

    // "eval_field(f)" is a closure for evaluating the "f" field
    // of the library models named in "vesta_kids"
    eval_field(f)(): binding {
        res = [];
        foreach lib in lib_models(vesta_kids) do {
            res += if lib!$f then lib/$f() else [];
        };
        return res;
    };

    // return result
    children = [ vesta = vesta_kids ];
    return [ lib, children,
      progs = eval_field("progs"),
      tests = eval_field("tests") ];
}
</PRE>

Unlike the previous examples, there are no auxiliary models in this
package: the <TT>lib</TT>, <TT>progs</TT>, and <TT>tests</TT> fields are bound to
locally-defined closures. This model is more complicated than the
previous ones, so a more thorough description is in order.<P>

The <TT>import</TT> clause selects the particular versions of those child
packages that are part of the umbrella. The "<TT>vesta_kids</TT>" value is
then used at the end of the model to form the set "<TT>children</TT>" of
qualified package names returned in the result. Notice how the extra
name "<TT>vesta</TT>" was inserted in the formation of the "<TT>children</TT>"
binding to qualify the package names.<P>

The model defines a local function, "<TT>lib_models(models)</TT>". Given
the argument "<TT>models</TT>", a collection of named packages, this
function iterates over the names and selects the corresponding
packages out of "<TT>./Cxx/libs/vesta</TT>", forming a list of the
resulting library package results. The actual models to which the
names are bound are ignored in case some
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#TransPkgOvsSec">transient package overrides</A>
were applied when the standard environment was constructed.<P>

The result of "<TT>lib_models(vesta_kids)</TT>" is then passed as the
second argument to the "<TT>./Cxx/umbrella</TT>" function in the "<TT>lib</TT>
closure.<P>

Finally, the umbrella model implements the "<TT>progs</TT>" and
"<TT>tests</TT>" closures by simply invoking the corresponding functions
of each of the child packages. It uses a
single, parameterized closure for this purpose. The closure iterates
over the package results in "<TT>lib_models(vesta_kids)</TT>", evaluates
the closure named by the "<TT>f</TT>" parameter if it is defined, and
overlays the result.
