<P>

<I>VCacheMonitor</I> is a client application for monitoring the state
of a running Vesta-2 function cache.<P>

The program starts by printing information that identifies the
function cache, including:
<UL>
<LI>
the name of the host on which the function cache is running,
<LI>
the port number on which the function cache is listening for connections,
<LI>
the root directory of the stable cache in which the function cache
stores cache entries,
<LI>
the version number of the interface implemented by the function cache,
and
<LI>
the date and time at which the function cache was started.
<LI>
the date and time at which VCacheMonitor was started
</UL>
<P>

The program then prints status lines describing various aspects of the
cache state. See the <A HREF="VCacheMonitor.1.html#FieldDescSect">Fields</A> section below for
descriptions of each of the fields on a status line.<P>

If <I>VCacheMonitor</I> is unable to contact the function cache it was
monitoring, it prints an error message and continues to poll the
function cache until a connection can be re-established. Once it is
able to contact the cache again, it resumes monitoring where it left
off.

<P>

Prefixes of switch names are recognized. For example, "-u"
can be used instead of "-update".<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="UpdateOpt"><B>-update</B> <I>time</I></A><DD>
By default, a new status line is printed every 10 seconds. If
<B>-update</B> is specified, then a new line is printed every
<I>time</I> seconds. <I>time</I> must be a non-negative integer.
To specify an update time in units other than seconds, <I>time</I>
can end with one of the following unit identifiers: <I>m</I> (minutes),
<I>h</I> (hours), and <I>d</I> (days).<P>

<DT><A NAME="TsOpt"><B>-ts</B> <I>time</I></A><DD>
If <B>-ts</B> is specified, a timestamp is printed every <I>time</I>
seconds. By default, timestamps are never printed. To specify a
timestamp interval in units other than seconds, <I>time</I>
can end with one of the following unit identifiers: <I>m</I> (minutes),
<I>h</I> (hours), and <I>d</I> (days).<P>

<DT><A NAME="NOpt"><B>-n</B> <I>num</I></A><DD>
By default, VCacheMonitor prints status lines indefinitely. If <B>-n</B>
is specified, then only <I>num</I> status lines are printed.<P>

<DT><A NAME="RowsOpt"><B>-rows</B> <I>num</I></A><DD>
By default, <I>VCacheMonitor</I> prints the column headings once at the
start of the program. If you specify <B>-rows</B> <I>num</I>, then new
heading columns are printed every <I>num</I> status lines.<P>

<DT><A NAME="CheckOpt"><B>-check</B></A><DD>
By default, <I>VCacheMonitor</I> prints the number of requested status
lines and then exits with status 0.  If <B>-check</B> is specified, it
will only attempt to print one line.  If it was able to successfully
contact the cache and print the line it will exit with status 0.  If
there was an error in reaching the cache or getting its status, it
will exit with status 1.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="FieldDescSect">Fields</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Each status line contains the following fields:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>SIZE</TT><DD>
The size of the function cache image (in bytes).<P>

<DT><TT>RES</TT><DD>
The size of the function cache image resident in physical memory (in bytes).<P>

<DT><TT>FREE VARS</TT><DD>
<DT><TT>LOOK UP</TT><DD>
<DT><TT>ADD ENT</TT><DD>
The number of calls to the function cache's <I>FreeVariables</I>,
<I>Lookup</I>, and <I>AddEntry</I> methods since the last status line was
printed. These values are indicative of the load on the function cache.
Since the values of these fields are relative to the previous status
line, no values are printed for them on the first status line.<P>

<DT><TT>NUM VMPK</TT><DD>
The number of volatile MultiPKFile objects in memory.<P>

<DT><TT>NUM VPKS</TT><DD>
The number of volatile PKFile objects in memory.<P>

<DT><TT>NUM ENTS</TT><DD>
The total number of entries in the cache (both in memory and on disk
in the stable cache).<P>

<DT><TT>NEW ENTS</TT><DD>
The number of new cache entries in memory. These entries have not been
written to the stable cache.<P>

<DT><TT>NEW PKLS</TT><DD>
The total size of the pickled values associated with the new entries
of the previous field.<P>

<DT><TT>OLD ENTS</TT><DD>
The number of "old" cache entries in memory. These are all entries
that reside in the stable cache, but have been "paged in"
for efficiency.<P>

<DT><TT>OLD PKLS</TT><DD>
The total size of the pickled values associated with the "old" entries
of the previous field.<P>

<DT><TT>NUM HF</TT><DD>
The number of entries in the function cache's hit filter. These are
entries that may soon be or are currently being deleted. This value
is non-zero only if a weed is in progress.<P>

<DT><TT>NUM DEL</TT><DD>
The number of cache entries currently being deleted. This value is
non-zero only if a weed is in progress.<P>

<DT><TT>MPK WEED</TT><DD>
The number of MultiPKFiles that must still be processed as part of a
weed.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, <I>VCacheMonitor</I> reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. It first looks for this file in the current directory;
if none is found there, it looks in your home directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The variables used by
<I>VCacheMonitor</I> are in the section denoted by <TT>[CacheServer]</TT>.
Here are the relevant variables and their meanings; the types of the
variables are shown in parentheses:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>Host</TT> (string)<DD>
The name of the host on which the function cache to be monitored is
running.<P>

<DT><TT>Port</TT> (integer)<DD>
The port number on which to contact the function cache.
</DL>
