This man page describes the notation used to document locking levels,
the locks used in the Vesta-2 cache server implementation, what data
they protect, and their relative locking order. The locks are also
documented separately in the individual header files.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The set of locks held by a thread is denoted by "LL". There is a
partial order on locks (see below). Every thread must acquire locks in
an ascending order, so at any time, the locks in the set "LL" form a
chain (total order). We use "Sup(LL)" to denote the supremum of the
locks in the chain "LL".<P>

Every method in the Cache Server should specify its locking
requirements. For example, in the "CacheS" object, a method may
specify:
<PRE>
  /* REQUIRES Sup(LL) = SELF.mu */
</PRE>

Here, "SELF" denotes the "CacheS" object, and "mu" denotes its mutex
field. So this method requires that the calling thread holds the mutex
"CacheS.mu" (and perhaps some locks ordered before "mu" in the lock
partial order).

<DL>
<DT><B>CacheS.mu</B> (the main cache server lock)<P>

<DD>Protects all of the cache server's global data, such as its leases,
volatile cache (the mapping from PK -&gt; VPKFile), the "usedCIs", the
"hitFilter", the cache's volatile cache, graph, and CI logs, and
other global data. <P>

<DT><B>CacheS.cacheLogMu</B>, <B>CacheS.graphLogMu</B>, <B>CacheS.ciLogMu</B><P>

<DD>Protect the disk operations on the stable cache, graph, and CI logs,
respectively. These are required because the read/write operations on a
VestaLog object (used to append to the logs atomically) are unmonitored.<P>

<DT><B>VPKFile.mu</B><P>

<DD>Protects the private data fields of each VPKFile object. This lock
also synchronizes access to the new cache entries stored under its
"newCommon" and "newUncommon" fields.<P>

<DT><B>OS::cio().mu</B><P>

<DD>Serializes debugging output. This lock should be held whenever the
cache server writes debugging output, so that a block of debugging
lines will appear together, even if multiple threads are writing
output. The lock is acquired using the "OS::cio().start_out" and
"OS::cio().start_err" methods and released using the
"OS::cio().end_out" and "OS::cio().end_err" methods. This lock is
unrelated to any of the other locks in the locking order, and may be
acquired so long as the lock is not already held.<P>

Note that this lock is private to an instance of the OS::ThreadIO
class.  See the files <TT>ThreadIO.H</TT> and <TT>ThreadIO.C</TT> in the
package <TT>/vesta/vestasys.org/basics/os</TT> for more information.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>CacheS Locks</B><P>

<DD>The server contains only one instantiation of the "CacheS" object.
Here are the relations on its locks:
<PRE>
  CacheS.ciLogMu &lt; CacheS.graphLogMu &lt; CacheS.cacheLogMu &lt; CacheS.mu
</PRE>

<DT><B>VPKFile Locks</B><P>

<DD>The server has a "VPKFile" object for each PK stored in volatile
memory. The order on these locks relative to the main cache server
lock is:
<PRE>
  (forall vf: VPKFile :: vf.mu &lt; CacheS.mu)
</PRE>

By this specification, a thread is not allowed to hold more than one
VPKFile lock at a time. However, there is one case where this is
necessary, namely, when a MultiPKFile is rewritten. Since the entire
MultiPKFile is updated on disk atomically, the thread doing the update
must acquire all of the locks for any changed VPKFile's within the
MultiPKFile. Hence, there is a partial order on the VPKFile locks. If
two VPKFile's "vpkf1" and "vpkf2" are mapped to the same MultiPKFile,
then "vpkf1.mu &lt; vpkf2.mu" iff "vpkf1" occurs in iteration order
before "vpkf2" in the table that maps PK's to VPKFile's that have
changed since the last time the MultiPKFile was rewritten. Even if
this order weren't defined, deadlock cannot occur, since at most one
thread can be rewriting a MultiPKFile at a time, and that is the only
situation in which a single thread must acquire multiple VPKFile locks.<P>

<DT><B>Debugging Lock</B><P>

<DD>The debugging lock exceeds all other locks in the partial order. This
means the lock can be acquired so long as it is not already held. Once
held, no other locks may be acquired.
<PRE>
  (forall mu: mutex :: mu &lt;= OS::cio().mu)
</PRE>

The universal quantification is taken over only those locks controlled
by the cache server.

<PRE>
  CacheS.ciLogMu &lt; CacheS.graphLogMu &lt; CacheS.cacheLogMu &lt; CacheS.mu
  (forall vf:  VPKFile :: vf.mu &lt; CacheS.mu)
  (forall mu:  mutex :: mu &lt;= OS::cio().mu)
</PRE>

The latter universal quantification is taken over only those locks
controlled by the cache server.
