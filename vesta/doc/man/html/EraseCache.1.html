EraseCache - delete files maintained by the Vesta-2 cache server
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Description</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<I>EraseCache</I> deletes files maintained by the Vesta-2 cache server.
In particular, it deletes the cache server's log files, stable cache
files (i.e., all of the so-called MultiPKFiles), and stable
variable files. It also deletes any stable files written by the
Vesta-2 weeder, <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html">VestaWeed(1)</A>.<P>

By default, the files containing the stable cache entries are not
listed when they are deleted, since there are likely to be so many of
them. If you specify the <B>-v</B> switch, all of the stable cache files
are listed as they are deleted.<P>

Since erasing a cache server's cache is a serious operation,
by default <I>EraseCache</I> displays the directory of the cache
that will be erased, and then asks for confirmation:
<PRE>
  Are you sure you want to erase this cache (y/n)?
</PRE>

The cache will only be erased if your response begins with the letter
"y". The <B>-f</B> switch forces the cache to be erased without a
request for confirmation.<P>

When you erase the cache files created by some cache server, you must
run <I>EraseCache</I> as the same user that ran the cache server that
created those files. In particular, to erase the centralized cache,
you must run <I>EraseCache</I> as <I>vestasrv</I>.<P>

When you run <I>EraseCache</I>, cache entries are only deleted from the
disk, not from the memory of a running cache server
<A HREF="VCache.1.html">VCache(1)</A>. To run the cache server on an empty
cache, you must kill any running instance of the cache server, run
<I>EraseCache</I>, and then restart the server.<P>

<B>Warning!</B> You should never erase a stable cache that is in use by
some cache server. Doing so will most likely cause the cache server to
crash. Be sure there is no cache server running on the stable cache in
question before using this program.

<H3>Configuration Variables</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<I>EraseCache</I> deletes files contained in a part of the filesystem
pointed to by the current Vesta configuration file. In particular, it
reads the following values from the <I>CacheServer</I> section of the
configuration file:
<PRE>
[CacheServer]
MetaDataRoot     - root of Vesta-2 meta-data
  MetaDataDir    - root of cache server meta-data sub-tree
    SCacheDir    - root of stable cache entries sub-tree
    SVarsDir     - root of stable variables sub-tree
    WeededLogDir - directory containing log of weeded MPKFiles
    CacheLogDir  - directory containing the cache log
    GraphLogDir  - directory containing the graph log
    CILogDir     - directory containing the used cache index log
</PRE>

It also reads the following value from the <I>Weeder</I> section of
the configuration file:
<PRE>
[Weeder]
  MetaDataDir    - root of weeder meta-data files
</PRE>

Nesting indicates how the directory tree corresponding to these names
is structured. If the <I>MetaDataRoot</I> value is the empty string,
then the current directory is used.
