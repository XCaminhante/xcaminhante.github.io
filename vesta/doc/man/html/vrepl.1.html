The <B>vrepl</B> command invokes the Vesta replicator to copy sources
from one Vesta repository to another.  See the
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section of the
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page for definitions of
terms.<P>

The source (-s) and destination (-d) repositories are specified by
Internet host name and (optionally) TCP port.  If omitted, both host
names and ports default to the values specified for the local
repository in the active Vesta configuration file (see the
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Configuration">Configuration</A> section below).  Alternatively, the string
"local" can be given for either option to explicitly specify the local
repository.<P>

The sources to copy are specified by <I>directives</I>, whose syntax is
defined in the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Directives">Directives</A> section below.
Directives can be given on the command line using one or more -e
flags, and/or in files using one or more -f flags.  The copying
obeys Vesta's replication design, which is summarized in the
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Vesta_Replication">Vesta Replication</A> section below.<P>

Wherever possible, the copying process avoids redundant data transfer
and preserves sharing.  If a file or directory is already present in
the destination under another name, the data is not transferred again.
If a directory is compressed in the source by being represented as a
delta with respect to a previous version, the compression is preserved
in the destination.  The presence or absence of this sharing is not
directly visible to users; it affects only the amount of disk and
memory space the repository consumes and the time and network
bandwidth required to run the replicator.<P>

For replication to be allowed, the user must have read permission in
the source repository and search permission in the destination
repository, and the destination repository must grant the source
repository permission to supply the value and attributes of each
object being copied.  The latter permission is granted if, searching
upward in the destination repository's directory tree from the object
in question, the first object found that has a <TT>#replicate-from</TT>
attribute includes the source host:port pair (or '<TT>*</TT>') in its
value.  In addition, permission to replicate everything except access
control attributes (attributes whose names begin with '<TT>#</TT>'; see
the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-a">-a</A> flag below) is granted if when searching upward,
the first object found that has a <TT>#replicate-from-noac</TT> attribute
includes the source host:port pair in its value.  If no objects with
these attributes are found, permission is denied.

<H3><A NAME="Flags">Flags</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Each boolean flag can be turned on by giving the corresponding letter
in lowercase or off by giving it in uppercase.  The 
flags -n, -o, -g, -b, and -l default to on; all others default to off.  
The flags -e and -f must appear after all other flags.<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-s">-s</A> srchost[:[srcport][:srcuser]]<DD>
Specifies the source repository by host name and TCP port number.
Both srchost and srcport default to the values specified for the local
repository in the active Vesta configuration file (see the
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Configuration">Configuration</A> section below).  Alternatively, the string
"local" can be given to explicitly specify the local repository.<P>

You can also specify the global user name under which you will access
the source repository.  The default is $USER@<I>realm</I>, where
$USER is your local user name and <I>realm</I> is the value of
[UserInterface]realm in the active Vesta configuration file.
If vrepl cannot authenticate you to the source repository as 
being the specified user, nothing will be replicated.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-d">-d</A> dsthost[:[dstport][:dstuser]]<DD>
Specifies the destination repository by host name and TCP port number.
Both dsthost and dstport default to the values specified for the local
repository in the active Vesta configuration file (see the 
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Configuration">Configuration</A> section below).  Alternatively, the string
"local" can be given to explicitly specify the local repository.<P>

You can also specify the global user name under which you will access
the destination repository.  The default is $USER@<I>realm</I>, where
$USER is your local user name and <I>realm</I> is the value of
[UserInterface]realm in the active Vesta configuration file.
If vrepl cannot authenticate you to the destination repository as 
being the specified user, nothing will be replicated.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-e">-e</A> directive<DD> Gives one replication directive.
Multiple -e and -f flags accumulate.  A space may
appear after the operator character in the directive;
for example, <TT>-e+ /vesta/foo</TT> is acceptable.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-f">[-f]</A> directive-file<DD>
Gives a file of repliction directives.  The "-f" can be omitted.
Multiple -e and -f flags accumulate.  
The directive-file name "-" specifies standard input.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-n">-n or -N</A><DD>
Copy (or do not copy) attributes on newly-created objects, 
including cases where a ghost or stub is replaced by a real object.
Default: on. <P>

<DT><A NAME="-o">-o or -O</A><DD>
Update (or do not update) attributes on old objects; that is, 
objects that are included in the set to
be copied but already exist at the destination.  Default: on.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-i">-i or -I</A><DD>
Update (or do not update) attributes on existing directories that
are not themselves
included in the set to be copied, but which appear internally in the
pathnames of objects that are included.  For example, if
/vesta/foo/bar is included but /vesta/foo is neither specifically
included nor excluded, and /vesta/foo already exists at the
destination, the attributes of /vesta/foo will be copied if and
only if this flag is on.  Default: off.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-a">-a or -A</A><DD>
Update (or do not update) access control attributes.
When copying or updating attributes, those whose names begin with '<TT>#</TT>'
are included only if this flag is on.  Default: on.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-r">-r or -R</A><DD>
Revive (or do not revive) ghosts in the destination, by replacing
them with real objects
where the source has them. Exception: a master ghost of an appendable
directory is not replaced.
The new destination object is given the same master or nonmaster status 
as the old ghost.
Default: off.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-m">-m or -M</A><DD> 
Revive (or do not revive) 
master ghosts of appendable directories in the destination by
replacing them with real objects where the source has them.  A new
directory created by this flag does <I>not</I> have master status;
that would be unsafe since the source copy is not known to have a
full set of children.  Hence the object no longer has a master copy.
This flag is for expert use only.  Default: off.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-b">-b or -B</A><DD>
Allow (or do not allow) stubs to be copied.  Default: on.  
Even when this flag is on, a stub
will not be copied if it would replace an object already present at
the destination.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-g">-g or -G</A><DD>
Allow (or do not allow) ghosts to be copied.  Default: on.  
Even when this flag is on, a ghost
will not be copied if it would replace an object already present at
the destination.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-l">-l or -L</A><DD>
Copy (or do not copy) "latest" symbolic links into the destination
where needed.  Default: on.  In detail, if an appendable directory
<I>A</I> has its <TT>type</TT> attribute set to <TT>package</TT>, <TT>checkout</TT>,
or <TT>session</TT>, and <I>A</I> is or has a descendant in the set to be
copied, and <I>A</I><TT>/latest</TT> is a stub or ghost, then
<I>A</I><TT>/latest</TT> and its attributes are copied too.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-v">-v or -V</A><DD>
Verbose: print (or do not print)
lines describing what the replicator is doing. Default: off.
Each line consists of a tag, a tab character, and a pathname.
The tags have the following meanings:<P>

<DL>
<DT>attribs<DD> The object's attributes are being copied.
<DT>copy<DD> The object is being copied in full.  If possible, the copying 
process is optimized by using data already present at the destination.
<DT>create<DD> An appendable directory is being created.  Its
children may or may not all be copied.
<DT>exists<DD> The object is not being copied because it already 
exists in the destination.  This includes the cases where a ghost
or stub is not copied because it would replace a 
real object in the destination.
<DT>ghost<DD> The object is not being copied because a ghost with
the same name exists in the destination and the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-r">-r</A>
or <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-m">-m</A> flag was not given.
<DT>latest<DD> The object is a "latest" stub being created because
the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-l">-l</A> flag was on.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><A NAME="-t">-t or -T</A><DD>
Test mode: skip (or do not skip) 
modifying the destination repository.  Default: off.
This flag is most useful in conjunction with <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-v">-v</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-w">-w or -W</A><DD> Warnings about bad imports: print a
warning message and continue (or print an error message and stop)
when an import from an '<TT>@</TT>' directive isn't present in the source
repository.  Default: off (terminate with an error).  This flag can be
useful with automatically generated replicator instructions where the
source repository contains incomplete replicas of the imports of some
models.<P>

<DT><A NAME="-c">-c or -C</A><DD>
Copy (or do not copy) new objects from the source repository to the
destination.  Default: on. Using the -C option will update the
attributes of objects which already exist in the destination
repository, but will not copy any new objects and will not replace
ghosts and stubs with real objects (even if the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-r">-r (revive
ghosts) flag</A> is given).<P>

<H3><A NAME="Directives">Directives</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

A directive is the operator character '<TT>+</TT>', '<TT>-</TT>', '<TT>@</TT>', 
or '<TT>.</TT>' followed
by a pathname or pathname pattern.  Zero or more spaces or tabs may
appear after the operator character.  A <B>vrepl</B> directives file is
a series of directives, one per line.  Blank lines and comment lines
(with the '<TT>#</TT>' character in the first column) are also allowed.  For
compatibility with old versions of vrepl, the operator character '<TT>&gt;</TT>'
is accepted as a synonym for '<TT>@</TT>'.<P>

The pattern language uses a syntax similar to Unix shell
filename wildcards with some extensions; it is described further
below.  Both the pattern language and the overall syntax and semantics
of the directives file are similar to those of the weeder instruction
files used by <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html"><B>VestaWeed</B>(1)</A>, again with
some extensions.<P>

Initially, the set of pathnames to be replicated is empty.  Each
directive adds or removes some pathnames from the set.  After the
directives file has been processed in full, the replicator copies
those pathnames that remain in the set.<P>

The '<TT>+</TT>' directive requests that pathnames matching the given pattern
be copied to the destination repository.  The pathname pattern in a '<TT>+</TT>'
directive must start with "/vesta".  If the pattern matches a
directory, it means that that directory is to be copied in full.  So
for example, "+/vesta" will copy the entire repository.<P>

The '<TT>-</TT>' directive requests that pathnames matching the specified 
pattern <I>not</I> be copied.  The pathname pattern in a '<TT>-</TT>' directive may start
with "/vesta", or it may be given relative to the most recent '<TT>+</TT>'
pattern.  In the latter case the pattern must not start with '<TT>/</TT>'.
Names that match the pattern are subtracted (set difference) from the
set of names to be copied.  For example, "+/vesta" followed by
"-foo" will copy the entire repository except for /vesta/foo.<P>

The '<TT>@</TT>' directive requests that models matching the specified
pattern and all their imports, both direct and indirect, be copied to
the destination repository.  It is an error for the pattern to match
something that is not a model.  The '<TT>@</TT>' directive works by first
expanding any metacharacters in the directive to produce a set of root
models to start from, then recursively processing the imports of each
root model to yield a '<TT>+</TT>' directive for each model in their
import trees.  These directives are then processed by the replicator
in place of the original '<TT>@</TT>' directive.  Subsequent '<TT>-</TT>'
directives can be used to prevent parts of the expansion of a '<TT>@</TT>'
directive from being replicated, but they have no effect on the
metacharacter expansion or the import tree traversal.  For example,
"@/vesta/example.com/*/main.ves" followed by
"-/vesta/example.com/foo/main.ves" will not copy foo/main.ves itself,
but it will still copy all of foo/main.ves's imports.<P>

The '<TT>.</TT>' directive must be followed by a plain pathname with no
metacharacters.  It causes vrepl to recursively read and process
additional directives from the named file before continuing with the
next directive in the current file.<P>

Immutable directories are always copied in full.  This has several
consequences.  When the '<TT>+</TT>' directive specifies a pathname whose
parent directory is immutable, the parent is also copied in full (and
so on recursively, up until the first appendable ancestor).  When the
'<TT>@</TT>' directive copies a model, it also copies the rest of the package
version that contains the model.  If a '<TT>-</TT>' directive specifies a
pathname whose parent is immutable and is selected for copying, it has
no effect; the child pathname is still copied.<P>

A pathname pattern is a sequence of arcs separated by '<TT>/</TT>'
characters.  Metacharacters can appear within an arc, but a
metacharacter cannot match a '<TT>/</TT>' except as specifically noted
below.  The following metacharacters are recognized.<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>*</TT><DD> Matches zero or more characters.<P>

<DT><TT>#</TT><DD> Matches zero or more decimal digits.<P>

<DT><TT>?</TT><DD> Matches a single character.<P>

<DT><TT>[</TT><I>chars</I><TT>]</TT><DD> Matches one of the characters listed in
<I>chars</I>.  The notation <I>b-e</I> may be used to mean the range of
ASCII characters from <I>b</I> through <I>e</I> inclusive.  Most
metacharacters lose their special meanings within brackets, but '<TT>/</TT>'
may not appear, '<TT>]</TT>' may appear only if it is the first character in
the list, '<TT>^</TT>' may appear only if it is not the first character in the
list, and '<TT>-</TT>' or '<TT>,</TT>' may appear only if it is the first or last
character in the list.<P>

<DT><TT>[^</TT><I>chars</I><TT>]</TT><DD> As above, but matches one of the characters not
in <I>chars</I>.<P>

<DT><TT>{</TT><I>p1</I><TT>,</TT><I>p2</I><TT>,</TT>...<TT>,</TT><I>pn</I><TT>}</TT><DD>
Matches any one of the patterns
<I>p1</I> through <I>pn</I>.  The patterns can contain arbitrary
metacharacters including nested <TT>{ }</TT>'s, but they cannot contain '<TT>/</TT>'
characters.<P>

<DT><TT>FIRST</TT><DD> Matches an arc in the current directory (as specified by
the previous arcs in the pattern) that consists entirely of decimal
digits, has no extra leading zeroes, is not bound to a ghost or stub, and
has the smallest numeric value of all such arcs.<P>

<DT><TT>LAST</TT><DD> Same as <TT>FIRST</TT>, except that the arc with the largest
numeric value is matched.<P>

<DT><TT>DFIRST</TT><DD> Same as <TT>FIRST</TT>, except that the arc with the
lowest interger-numbered directory entry in the <I>destination</I>
repository is matched.  If the current directory contains no
interger-numbered entries or doesn't exist in the destination
repository, expands to -1.<P>

<DT><TT>DLAST</TT><DD> Same as <TT>LAST</TT>, except that the arc with the
highest interger-numbered directory entry in the <I>destination</I>
repository is matched.  If the current directory contains no
interger-numbered entries or doesn't exist in the destination
repository, expands to -1.<P>

<DT><TT>[</TT>exprLow<TT>,</TT>exprHigh<TT>]</TT><DD> Matches a nonempty sequence of decimal
digits whose numeric value is in the closed interval [exprLow,
exprHigh].  Here <I>exprLow</I> and <I>exprHigh</I> are integer-valued
expressions &lt;expr&gt; of the form &lt;value&gt; or &lt;expr&gt;&lt;op&gt;&lt;value&gt;, where
&lt;value&gt; is either a decimal number, <TT>FIRST</TT>, <TT>LAST</TT>, <TT>DFIRST</TT> 
or <TT>DLAST</TT> and &lt;op&gt; is either '<TT>+</TT>' or '<TT>-</TT>'.  The 
tokens <TT>FIRST</TT>, <TT>LAST</TT>, <TT>DFIRST</TT> and <TT>DLAST</TT> have the same meaning 
as when they appear alone.  For example, "/vesta/foo/bar/[LAST-2,LAST]" would
match any of the three most recent versions of the foo/bar package and
"/vesta/foo/bar/[DLAST+1,LAST]" would match any versions of foo/bar package 
that are newer then the latest at the destination.<P>

<DT><TT>%</TT><DD> If the first character of a pattern arc is '<TT>%</TT>', 
the remainder 
of the pattern arc matches zero or more complete arcs in the repository.
For example, the pattern "/vesta/%*/checkout" matches every checkout
directory in the repository, no matter how many levels below the root
it is.  This is the only case where a metacharacter can match a string
containing '<TT>/</TT>'.<P>

<H3><A NAME="Vesta_Replication">Vesta Replication Design</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Here is a summary of Vesta's replication design; for background and
further details, see <I>Vesta: A System for Software Configuration
Management</I>.<P>

Conceptually, all sources stored in all Vesta repositories are named
in one single, global name space.  Each repository stores some subtree
of the complete name space.  Replication is present when the subtrees
stored by two different repositories overlap; that is, some of the
same names occur in both.  Repositories <I>agree</I> (are consistent) if
(1) there are no cases where the same name means something different
in two different repositories, and (2) each name is designated 
as <I>master</I> in at most one repository.  A new, empty repository
initially agrees with every other repository, and it will continue to
do so as long as it follows Vesta's rules for choosing new source
names locally and for replicating existing sources from other
repositories.<P>

It is perfectly acceptable (and in fact common) for a name to be bound
in some repositories and unbound in others.  It is also acceptable for
a name to be bound to either of the special object types <I>ghost</I>
or <I>nonmaster stub</I> in some repositories and to something else in
others; these types are placeholders for objects that are not
replicated in the current repository but may exist elsewhere.  We
sometimes use the term <I>real object</I> for an object that is neither
a ghost nor a stub.<P>

Mastership is important chiefly for appendable directories.  The master
copy of an appendable directory is the synchronization point for
adding new names to the directory.  Arbitrary new names can be freely
added to a master appendable directory, but new names can be added to
a nonmaster appendable directory only by copying them from another
repository.  The master copy of an appendable directory must contain
an entry for every name that is bound in any other replica of the
directory, and names can never be deleted from it.  (Names of objects
that are not wanted in the master copy's repository can be bound to
stubs or ghosts there.)  These rules ensure that users do not
inadvertently create different objects with the same name at different
repositories, or inadvertently create a new object with a name that
was formerly used for a different, deleted object.<P>

Mastership is also important for stubs.  A master stub can be
freely replaced with a newly created source of any type, while a
nonmaster stub can be replaced only by copying from another
repository.  (In either case, the new source has the same mastership
status as the old stub.)  Master stubs are used by <B>vcheckout</B> to
reserve new version numbers for checked-out packages.  Nonmaster stubs
are used only as placeholders.<P>

There is a small difference between master and nonmaster ghosts as
well.  Both types of ghosts indicate that a previously existing source
has been deleted.  Either type can be replaced by a copy of the source
taken from another replica, with the new source retaining the
mastership status of the old ghost, <I>except</I> that a master ghost
cannot be changed to a master appendable directory or master stub.  It
is unsafe to change a master ghost to a master appendable directory
unless you can guarantee to restore all the names that were bound in
the directory at the time it was deleted.  It is impermissible to
change a master ghost to a master stub, because the master stub could
in turn be replaced by an arbitrary object different from the name's
original, pre-ghost value, thus violating Vesta's immutability
guarantee.<P>

For other types of objects, the rule that a name has at most one
master remains, but mastership has no other enforced meaning.  By
convention, however, the master copy of an object can be thought of as the
"main" copy, which should not be deleted (or replaced with a ghost)
without thinking twice.<P>

The <B>vrepl</B> command observes an additional convention regarding
ghosts.  Because a ghost is a record that a name has been deleted,
<B>vrepl</B> considers a ghost to be evidence that the destination
repository does not want a copy of the source bound to that name.
Thus a source will not be copied to replace a ghost unless the
revive (<A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-r">-r</A>) flag is specified.<P>

Vesta's mutable attribute feature is designed to work well with
replication.  An object's attributes are represented internally as a
timestamped history of changes.  Changes made at two different sites
can thus be merged with well-defined, meaningful results; we omit the
details here.<P>

Even access control attributes can be replicated.  Access control
attributes use global group and user names that include a name for the
site of origin, or <I>realm</I>; for example, user mann@pa.dec.com or 
group ^staff@pa.dec.com.
Replication of access
control attributes is useful only
when sites are closely cooperating and have a fairly high degree of
mutual trust.  If you do not want another site to be able to influence
the access permissions on objects you copy from it, you should not
replicate their access control attributes.<P>

By default, attributes on the objects you are actually copying will be
replicated, but attributes on existing parent directories will not be
updated.  You can turn on replication of attributes on enclosing
directories with the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#-i">-i</A> flag.  However, if you do this,
beware of updating access control attributes on upper-level
directories (e.g. those on the repository root, <TT>/vesta</TT>, itself).

It might be nice to have a way to make the destination just like the
source by deleting (ghosting) things in the destination that are not
in the source.  This is dangerous, and it probably needs to be broken
up into multiple flags that carefully consider the cases where the
source/destination is/isn't the master for the object/parent.
