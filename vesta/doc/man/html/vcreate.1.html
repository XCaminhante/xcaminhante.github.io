See the <A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html">vesta-intro</A> man page's
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Terminology">Terminology</A> section
for definitions of terms, and its
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A>
section for an explanation of how names are looked up.<P>

The <B>vcreate</B> command creates a new package in the Vesta
repository.  The package initially is not checked out;
use <A HREF="vcheckout.1.html"><B>vcheckout</B>(1)</A> to check it out
and begin creating version 1.<P>

By default, the new package initially contains version 0 as an empty
directory.  If an old version is specified with the -o flag, it is
copied into the new package as version 0.<P>

In more detail, <B>vcreate</B>:
<UL>
<LI> Prompts the user to enter a package descriptive <I>message</I>.
(<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Message">See the "Message Entry" section below.</A>)
<LI> Creates a new appendable directory named 
<I>package</I>, containing an appendable subdirectory named <TT>checkout</TT>.  
<LI> Creates a master stub named <TT>latest</TT> in each of these
directories.
<LI> Binds the name <I>package</I><TT>/0</TT> to the same immutable
directory named by <I>old-version</I>, if specified, or to an empty
directory.
<LI> Sets attributes as follows:
<DL>
<DT>On <I>package</I><DD>
<TT>created-by</TT>, <TT>creation-time</TT>, <TT>old-version</TT> if specified,

<P>

If the name <I>package</I> or <I>old-version</I> is unqualified (does not
have "<TT>/</TT>", "<TT>.</TT>", or "<TT>..</TT>"  as its first arc), it is interpreted
relative to the site's default directory of packages,
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><I>DefaultPackageParent</I></A>.<P>

You must have write access to the directory in which <I>package</I> is
to be placed. The newly created package is owned by you, but has
access permissions inherited from its parent directory.<P>

In the presence of replication, package creation cannot always be
carried out entirely in the local repository.  In particular, the
local repository may contain no replica of one of the needed objects,
or it may contain a non-master replica where the master replica is
needed.  Also, the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-a/-A</A> flags control which repository
<B>vcreate</B> will give mastership of the created package.  (See
<A HREF="vrepl.1.html"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> and
<A HREF="vmaster.1.html"><B>vmaster</B>(1)</A> for more information about
replication and mastership.)  The exact steps are slightly different
depending on which repository has the master copy of the parent
directory of <I>package</I> and whether the local repository is to have
the master copy of the created package (controlled by the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-a/-A</A> flags).<P>

If the parent directory of <I>package</I> is mastered locally,
<B>vcreate</B> creates the package in the local repository (and the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-a/-A</A> flags have no effect).  However, if
<I>old-version</I> was specified and does not exist locally,
<B>vcreate</B> searches for a copy and replicates it to the local
repository before creating the package.<P>

If the parent directory of <I>package</I> is not mastered locally,
<B>vcreate</B> may give mastership of <I>package</I> to the local
repository, if either the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-a</A> flag is specified or
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#vcreate_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vcreate_acquires</I></A> is set
to true.  If <I>old-version</I> was specified and does not exist
locally, <B>vcreate</B> searches for a copy and replicates it to the
local repository.  <B>vcreate</B> then creates the package remotely in
the master copy (except for inserting <I>old-version</I>), replicates it
to the local repository, transfers mastership, and finally inserts
<I>old-version</I>.<P>

If the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-A</A> flag is specified or
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#vcreate_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vcreate_acquires</I></A> is set
to false and the parent directory of <I>package</I> is mastered
remotely, <B>vcreate</B> will leave mastership of <I>package</I> with the
master repository of its parent directory.  In this case, if
<I>old-version</I> was specified and does not exist in the remote master
repository, <B>vcreate</B> searches for a copy and replicates it to that
repository.  <B>vcreate</B> then creates the package remotely in the
master copy (including inserting <I>old-version</I>), and replicates it
to the local repository.<P>

<B>vcreate</B> returns status 0 for success, 1 for parameter syntax
errors, or 2 for more serious errors.  (Note that if any of the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Triggers">trigger commands</A> fail, <B>vcreate</B> returns status
2.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="-q">-q</A><DD>
Quiet; suppress printing out what is being done.
<DT><A NAME="-Q">-Q</A><DD>
Query; print out what the command would do, but don't do it.
<DT><A NAME="-o">-o</A> <I>old-version</I><DD>
Specifies the initial content (version 0) for the new package.
Must be an immutable directory, typically a version of some other package.
By default, version 0 is an empty directory.  Hint: if you are using this flag,
you might want to consider using <A HREF="vbranch.1.html"><B>vbranch</B>(1)</A>
instead.  Perhaps you are really creating a branch of an existing package,
not a completely new package.
<DT><A NAME="-O">-O</A><DD>
Create version 0 as an empty directory in the new package (default).
<DT><A NAME="-m">-m</A> <I>message</I><DD>
Specify the package descriptive message.  If the <I>message</I> argument
is <TT>"-"</TT>, the user will be prompted to enter a message.
(<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Message">See the "Message Entry" section below.</A>)  If
<I>message</I> is any other text, it will be used as the package
descriptive message without prompting the user.  If neither the -m
flag nor the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-M">-M flag</A> is used, the default is "<TT>-m -</TT>"
(although this can be changed with the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><TT>[UserInterface]vcreate_message</TT>
configuration setting</A>).
<DT><A NAME="-M">-M</A><DD>
Omit the package descriptive message.
<DT><A NAME="-h">-h</A> <I>hints</I><DD>
If <B>vcreate</B> fails to find the master copy of a directory it needs
to modify (or fails to find any copy of the old version) in either the
local repository or any of those repositories listed in
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><I>[UserInterface]DefaultHints</I></A>, you can
suggest additional repositories for it to look in using this option.
The <I>hints</I> argument is a comma- or space-separated list of
repositories, specified by host name and TCP port number in the format
<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.  The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted;
it defaults to
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-R">-R</A> <I>repos</I><DD>
Create the package in <I>repos</I> instead of the default local
repository.  The repository is
specified by host name and TCP port number 
in the format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.
The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be omitted; it
defaults to <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I></A>.
<DT><A NAME="-aA">-a or -A</A><DD>
Do (-a) or do not (-A) acquire mastership of the created package when
the local repository doesn't have mastership of the parent directory.
The default is controlled by the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#vcreate_acquires"><I>[UserInterface]vcreate_acquires</I></A>
configuration setting.  (Note that if the parent directory of
<I>package</I> is mastered in the local repository, these flags have no
effect.)
<DT><A NAME="-f">-f</A><DD>
Force; omit sanity checking.  If the -f flag is not given, the new
package's parent directory must be of type "package-parent" (that is,
its <TT>type</TT> attribute must include this value).  To create a new
directory that can hold packages, use mkdir(1), then use
<A HREF="vattrib.1.html"><B>vattrib</B>(1)</A> to add the necessary attribute,
or use <A HREF="vmkdir.1.html"><B>vmkdir</B>(1)</A> with it's
<A HREF="vmkdir.1.html#-p">-p flag</A>.
<DT><A NAME="-v">-v</A><DD>
Displays extra information about <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Triggers">triggers</A>.  Before
executing any trigger commands, the environment variables used to
provide information to them are printed.  Also, each trigger setting
is printed before the command is executed.  This can be used to help
debug trigger problems.  When used with <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-Q">the query flag
(-Q)</A>, the triggers are displayed in their sorted order without
actually running them.

<H3><A NAME="Message">Message Entry</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<B>vcreate</B>'s default behavior is to prompt the user for a
<I>package descriptive message</I>.  If the <TT>EDITOR</TT>
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Env_Vars">environment variable</A> is set, the external editor
program it specifies is invoked to edit the message.  Otherwise, the
message is read from standard input.  A prompt is printed if the
standard input is a terminal:
<PRE>
Enter package description, terminated with ^D or . on a line by itself
: 
</PRE>

If the standard input is not a terminal (e.g. it was redirected to a
file or a pipe), no prompt will be printed, but the standard input
will still be used as the package descriptive message.  (Note that
when <TT>EDITOR</TT> is set, the external editor is invoked even if the
standard input is not a terminal.)<P>

When using an external editor, the initial text will be "<TT>&lt;enter
package description here&gt;</TT>".  If the initial text is left unedited or
the user enters an empty message, they will be asked for confirmation
before completing the operation:
<PRE>
Empty package description.  Continue (y/n)? 
</PRE>

This is the only chance to abort when <TT>EDITOR</TT> is set.  (So if you
change your mind and are using an external editor, exit the editor
either with the message unedited or with an empty message.)<P>

The <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-m">-m flag</A> can be used to specify the package descriptive
message on the command line.  The <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-M">-M flag</A> can be used to
omit the package descriptive message.  In either of these cases, no
external editor will be invoked, and the standard input will not be
read.<P>

The default of prompting for a package descriptive message can be
disabled with the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><TT>[UserInterface]vcreate_message</TT>
configuration setting</A>.  However, this can be overridden on the
command line with "<TT>-m -</TT>", which will always cause <B>vcreate</B> to
prompt for a package descriptive message.

<H3><A NAME="Configuration">Configuration</A></H3>

<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[UserInterface]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file (vesta.cfg).<P>

<DL>
<DT><I>AppendableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the global root directory of
Vesta repositories is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta</TT>.
<DT><I>MutableRootName</I><DD>
The filename under which the local tree of mutable directories provided
by Vesta is mounted.  Ordinarily set to <TT>/vesta-work</TT>.
<DT><I>DefaultPackageParent</I><DD>
The default directory to put new packages in.  Ordinarily a
subdirectory of the appendable root, named with an Internet domain name
belonging to the local site.
<DT><I>DefaultWorkParent</I><DD>
The default parent directory for mutable working directory trees belonging to
individual users.  Ordinarily the same as the mutable root.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is optional.  If it is not set,
<TT>[Repository]realm</TT> is used.
<DT><I>TimeFormat</I><DD>
A format string for <B>strftime</B>(3) to produce time strings for Vesta
attributes.  A common setting is "%a %b %e %T %Z %Y".
<DT><A NAME="vcreate_acquires"><I>vcreate_acquires</I></A><DD>
Sets the default policy for which repository should have mastership of
the created package when the master repository of the parent directory
is remote.  If it is equal (witout regard to case) to "yes", "on", or
"true", or can be parsed as an integer that is non-zero, the local
repository will acquire mastership (as if the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-a</A> flag had
been given).  If it is equal (witout regard to case) to "no", "off",
or "false", or can be parsed as an integer that is zero, the master
repository of the parent directory will retain mastership of the
created package (as if the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">-A</A> flag had been given).  If
not set, defaults to "false".
<DT><I>DefaultHints</I><DD>
A comma- or space-separated list of additional repositories to search
for the master copy of an object and for a copy of <I>old-version</I>.
Each repository is specified by host name and TCP port number in the
format <I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>.  The <TT>:</TT><I>port</I> portion may be
omitted; it defaults to <I>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</I>.  This
setting is optional.
<DT><I>vcreate_message</I><DD>
A boolean configuration setting.  Determines whether <B>vcreate</B> will
prompt the user for a descriptive message.  If it is equal (without
regard to case) to "yes", "on", or "true", or can be parsed as an
integer that is non-zero, <B>vcreate</B> will ask the user to enter a
message (as if "<TT><A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-m">-m</A> -</TT>" had been given on the command
line).  If it is equal (without regard to case) to "no", "off", or
"false", or can be parsed as an integer that is zero, <B>vcreate</B>
will not prompt for a message (as if the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-M">-M</A> flag had been
given).  If not set, defaults to "true".
</DL>
<P>

The following values are obtained from the <TT>[Repository]</TT> section of the
Vesta configuration file.
<DL>
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_host</I><DD>
The host name of the default (local) repository.
<DT><I>VestaSourceSRPC_port</I><DD>
The default TCP port number for repositories.
<DT><I>realm</I><DD>
Global user names are formed by appending <TT>@</TT><I>realm</I> to the
local name.  This setting is only used if <TT>[UserInterface]realm</TT> is
not set.
</DL>
<P>

Settings in the <TT>[vcreate pre trigger]</TT> and <TT>[vcreate post
trigger]</TT> sections of the configuration file are used as commands to
be run before and after the repository is modified.  See
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Triggers">the next section</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Triggers">Triggers</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Users can configure commands in <A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html">the Vesta
configuration file (vesta.cfg)</A> to be executed before and after
<B>vcreate</B> modifies the repository.  Each setting in the
<TT>[vcreate pre trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run
before any action is taken, and each setting in the <TT>[vcreate post
trigger]</TT> section specifies a command to be run after all actions are
complete.<P>

The value of each setting specifies a command to run.  The names of
the settings define the order in which these commands are run.  The
setting names are sorted as strings, but comparing embedded sequences
of digits as decimal integers.  (So, for example "foo_10_bar" will
sort after "foo_2_bar".)  The suggested naming convention for trigger
settings is to start with an integer, follow with a descriptive name,
and follow that with any other text.  (This is based on the convention
used for System V style init script links typically stored in
<TT>/etc/rc<I><B>N</B></I>.d</TT>.)<P>

Here's a simple example of how we suggest naming trigger settings, and
how they are ordered for execution:
<PRE>
[vcreate pre trigger]
100world = echo World!
9tada    = echo Tada:
50hello  = echo Hello,
</PRE>

Because these all start with numbers, they will be executed in the
order "9tada", "50hello", "100world".  The output will look like this:
<PRE>
% vcreate /vesta/example.com/...
Tada:
Hello,
World!
Creating package /vesta/example.com/...
</PRE>

Trigger commands are executed with <TT>system</TT>(3).  On most operating
systems this means "<TT>/bin/sh -c <I>command</I></TT>", so simple in-line
shell scripts can be used.  (Note that each is executed in its own
shell process, so environment variables set during one trigger command
<I>will not propagate to subsequent ones</I>.)<P>

If any of the commands in the <TT>[vcreate pre trigger]</TT> section exit
with error (non-zero) status or are terminated by a signal
(e.g. segmentation fault, abort), <B>vcreate</B> will exit without
creating a package.<P>

The commands in the <TT>[vcreate post trigger]</TT> section will only be
executed if a new package is successfully created.  If <B>vcreate</B>
fails with an error, the commands in the <TT>[vcreate post trigger]</TT>
section <I>will not be executed</I>.<P>

Note that all the trigger commands (both pre and post) are executed
sequentially.  Once a trigger command is started, nothing else happens
until it completes.  If any of the pre trigger commands runs forever,
<B>vcreate</B> will not create a package.  If any of the post trigger
commands runs forever, <B>vcreate</B> will not complete.  (In other
words, <I>a trigger command that hangs will cause <B>vcreate</B> to
hang</I>.)  If any of the pre or post trigger commands exit with error
status or are terminated by a signal, <B>vcreate</B> will exit without
running any more commands from those sections.  (In other words, <I>a
trigger command that fails will prevent further trigger commands from
being run</I>.)<P>

If the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> is given, the trigger commands
will not actually be run.<P>

Information about what <B>vcreate</B> is going to do or has just done
is provided to the trigger commands through the following environment
variables:<P>

<DL>
<DT>VESTA_TOOL<DD>
The name of the Vesta tool the trigger command has been invoked from.
(For <B>vcreate</B>, this will always be "vcreate".)
<DT>VESTA_REPOS<DD>
The local repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) <B>vcreate</B>
communicates with (either the default from the configuration file or
the one specified with the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-R">-R flag</A>.
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_HINTS<DD>
Additional repositories which may have been consulted in order to find
the master copy of the parent directory of the package.  This is the
combination of the argument to the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-h">-h flag</A> (if it was
used) and the hints from the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><I>[UserInterface]DefaultHints</I> configuration
setting</A> (if set in the configuration file).
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_REMOTE<DD>
Set to 1 if the parent directory of the package created by
<B>vcreate</B> is mastered in a remote repository, set to 0 otherwise.
If this is set to 1, the package will be created in the remote
master ($VESTA_MASTER_REPOS) and replicated to the local repository
($VESTA_REPOS).
<DT>VESTA_MASTER_REPOS<DD>
The repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) with mastership of the
parent directory of the package created by <B>vcreate</B>.  If this is
different from $VESTA_REPOS, $VESTA_MASTER_REMOTE will be set to 1 and
the package is created at the remote master repository.
<DT>VESTA_PACKAGE<DD>
The package created by <B>vcreate</B>.
<DT>VESTA_OLD_VERSION<DD>
The path to the version the package will be based upon (specified with
the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-o">-o flag</A>).  This will become version 0 within the
created package.
<DT>VESTA_OMIT_OLD_VERSION<DD>
Set to 1 if there is no old version (which is the default unless the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-o">-o flag</A> is given), set to 0 otherwise.
<DT>VESTA_OLD_VERSION_REMOTE<DD>
Set to 1 if the old version was not found in the master repository of
the package parent ($VESTA_MASTER_REPOS), set to 0 otherwise.  If set
to 1, the old version will be replicated from the repository where it
was found ($VESTA_OLD_VERSION_REPOS) to the master repository of the
package parent directory before creating the package.
<DT>VESTA_OLD_VERSION_REPOS<DD>
The repository (<I>host</I><TT>:</TT><I>port</I>) where a replica of the old
version was found.  If this is different from $VESTA_MASTER_REPOS,
$VESTA_OLD_VERSION_REMOTE will be 1.  If there is no old version, this
will be set to the empty string.
<DT>VESTA_ACQUIRE_MASTERSHIP<DD>
Set to 1 if <B>vcreate</B> is creating a package at a remote master
repository and acquiring mastership of it in the local repository, set
to 0 otherwise.  (If $VESTA_REPOS is the same as $VESTA_MASTER_REPOS
this will be 0.)  See <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-aA">the description of the -a/-A flags
above</A>.
<DT>VESTA_MESSAGE<DD>
The package description message, or the empty string if there is no
description message.
<DT>VESTA_OMIT_MESSAGE<DD>
Set to 1 if there is no package description message (if <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-M">the
-M flag</A> was given or
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#Configuration"><TT>[UserInterface]vcreate_message</TT></A> was used to
disable package messages), set to 0 otherwise.
<DT>VESTA_QUIET<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-q">the quiet flag (-q) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
<DT>VESTA_FORCE<DD>
Set to 1 if <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-f">the force flag (-f) was given</A>, set to 0
otherwise.
</DL>
<P>

(Note that the environment variables are the same for both the pre and
post trigger commands.)<P>

Here are some examples using these environment variables:
<PRE>
[vcreate pre trigger]
// If the enclosing directory has a non-empty "obsolete" attribute,
// prevent new packages from being created there.
50no_obsolete = parent=`dirname $VESTA_PACKAGE` if vattrib -q -G obsolete $parent &gt; /dev/null; then echo "Error: $parent is marked obsolete"; exit 1; fi

[vcreate post trigger]
// Replicate all new packages to known peer repositories
50repl = for r in $VESTA_MASTER_HINTS; do vrepl -s $VESTA_REPOS -d $r -e+ $VESTA_PACKAGE; done
</PRE>

If the <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag (-v)</A> is given, these
environment variables will be printed, and each trigger command will
be printed before executing it.  This can be useful for debugging
trigger problems.  If both <A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-v">verbose trigger flag</A> and the
<A HREF="vcreate.1.html#-Q">the query flag (-Q)</A> are given, the triggers are displayed
in their sorted order without actually running them.  This can be used
to find out what trigger commands are configured without actually

<B>vcreate</B> is atomic if it modifies only the local
repository.  If a remote repository must be modified, however, the
action performed at each repository is individually atomic, but
<B>vcreate</B> can die between the actions on the remote and local
repositories.  To make this problem less likely to occur, <B>vcreate</B>
ignores <TT>SIGINT</TT> (the ^C interrupt) during the critical section.
