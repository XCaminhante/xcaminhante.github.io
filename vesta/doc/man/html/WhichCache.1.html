WhichCache - print the identity of the Vesta cache server
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Description</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The Vesta tools consult the user's Vesta configuration file to
determine various things about the Vesta system's configuration. Among
other things, the configuration file contains the identity of a Vesta
cache server.<P>

A Vesta cache server is identified by three things:<P>

<UL>
<LI>
the hostname on which the cache server is running,
<LI>
the port on which that cache server is listening for connections, and
<LI>
the root directory of that cache server's stable cache
</UL>
<P>

This simple shell script prints the values of those three
configuration settings.

<H3><A NAME="ConfigSect">Configuration Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Like most Vesta-2 applications, <I>WhichCache</I> reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 <I>configuration file</I> named
<I>vesta.cfg</I>. The program first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory.<P>

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by <TT>[</TT><I>SectionName</I><TT>]</TT>. The variables used by
<I>WhichCache</I> are in the section denoted by <TT>[CacheServer]</TT>.
Here are the variables and their meanings; the types of the variables
are shown in parentheses.<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>Host</TT> (string)<DD>
The hostname of the machine on which the cache server is running.<P>

<DT><TT>Port</TT> (integer)<DD>
The port number on the host named by <I>Host</I> to contact. This allows
multiple cache servers to be running on the same machine; each one
listens on a different port for connections.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataRoot</TT> (string)<DD>
The pathname of the directory in which the Vesta system's metadata is
stored. If this variable is undefined, the current directory is used.
Other configuration variables are interpreted relative to this path.<P>

<DT><TT>MetaDataDir</TT> (string)<DD>
The directory (relative to the MetaDataRoot) in which the cache
server's metadata is stored.
</DL>
