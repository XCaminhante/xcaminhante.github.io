<H3><A NAME="ReqsSect">Limitations and Architectural Dependencies</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This section describes the known limitations and dependencies of the
<I>VCache</I> implementation.<P>

<DL>
<DT>Representing Fingerprints<DD>
The current implementation of fingerprints is heavily
machine-dependent. In particular, the implementation assumes that the
machine uses little-endian byte order and that the C++ compiler provides
a 64-bit integer type.  (The Vesta header file Basics.H defines the names
Word and Bit64 for this type; the fingerprint implementation uses Word.)<P>

<DT>Marshalling Fingerprints<DD>
The fingerprint marshalling code treats the fingerprint as a buffer of
bytes, so the format of the fingerprint on the wire depends on the
endian-ness of the machine sending the fingerprint. In particular, the
current code will not work in a heterogeneous environment where the
endian-ness of clients and servers differ. If the SRPC interface were
extended to provide procedures for sending 64-bit integers in a
canonical form down the wire, it would be trivial to marshal
fingerprints in a canonical way as well.<P>

<DT>Marshalling Timestamps<DD>
The <TT>OtherTypes</TT> interface defines a "<TT>TS::T</TT>" to be equivalent
to the Unix type "<TT>time_t</TT>", which happens to be defined as an
"<TT>int</TT>". A "<TT>TS::T</TT>" value is marshalled as an "<TT>int</TT>".
However, if the type of "<TT>time_t</TT>" were changed, this strategy
would break.

<H3><A NAME="LogUsage">Cache Server Logs and Stable Variables</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This section describes the logs and stable variable files used by the
cache server. For each log, this includes an indication as to whether
the log is checkpointed, and if so, which method performs the
checkpoint and what the checkpoint contains.<P>

<B>Log Files</B><P>

<DL>
<DT>CacheLog<DD>
The CacheLog contains a record of the cache entries that have not been
written to the stable cache (i.e., to some MultiPKFile). The CacheLog
is checkpointed by the <TT>CacheS::CleanCacheLog</TT> procedure, which
prunes the CacheLog by filtering out all cache entries whose
<TT>pkEpoch</TT> values indicate that the cache entry has been written to
the stable cache. The checkpoint file is written by a background
thread while other threads can continue to add entries to the
CacheLog.  Entries in the CacheLog consist of the arguments sent by
the client when adding the entry plus the cache index allocated for
the entry and the <TT>pkEpoch</TT> of its PKFile when it was added.<P>

<DT>CILog<DD>
The CILog contains the set of cache entry indices (CIs) in use. It is
checkpointed by the <TT>CacheS::ChkptUsedCIs</TT> method, which is called
by the <TT>CacheS_DoDeletions</TT> function after all of the MultiPKFiles
that have weeded entries have been rewritten. Hence, a new CILog
checkpoint is created in response to a successful run of the weeder.
A CILog checkpoint file contains a bit vector of the CIs in use, while
the log files contain <TT>Intvl::T</TT> records.<P>

<DT>EmptyPKLog<DD>
The EmptyPKLog contains a sequence of "(pk, pkEpoch)" pairs recording
the pkEpoch values of PKFile's that have become empty (or that once
were empty. The EmptyPKLog is checkpointed by the
<TT>CacheS::CleanCacheLog</TT> procedure, as part of cleaning the cache
log. Once the cache log has been cleaned, values that were placed in
the EmptyPKLog before the start of cleaning are no longer needed (but
any values placed in the log during cleaning are still required).  The
cache server deletes old EmptyPKLog entries by beginning an EmptyPKLog
checkpoint just before starting cleaning and committing it just after
cleaning is successfully completed.  Nothing is written to the
checkpoint file.<P>

<DT>GraphLog<DD>
The GraphLog is a representation of the cache entry DAG that is
written by the cache server and read by the weeder. The GraphLog
contains two kinds of entries: nodes and roots. The nodes correspond
to cache entries, and the roots correspond to top-level evaluations
(or checkpoints of partially-completed evaluations) that the weeder
uses as roots of its mark phase.<P>

The GraphLog is checkpointed by the <TT>CacheS::StartMark</TT> method, and
the checkpoint is committed by the <TT>CacheS::CommitChkpt</TT> method.
Both of these methods are invoked by the weeder, and it is the weeder
that actually writes the checkpoint file. The checkpoint file is in
the same format as the log files.<P>

<DT>WeededLog<DD>
Abstractly, the WeededLog contains a lower bound on the number of
MultiPKFiles in the MPKsToWeed file that have been successfully
processed. The WeededLog is only meaningful if the Deleting stable
variable is true, that is, while cache entries are being deleted in
response to a successful run of the weeder. If the cache server
crashes while performing such deletions, the WeededLog is recovered so
that all of the deletions do not have to be repeated.<P>

The log contains a sequence of integers, the sum of which denotes the
number of MultiPKFiles that have been successfully processed. The
WeededLog is checkpointed by the <TT>CacheS::ResetWeededMPKs</TT> method
during the <TT>CacheS::EndMark</TT> method. Nothing is written into the
checkpoint file; the purpose of performing the checkpoint is to simply
start a new empty log. New entries are written to the log by the
<TT>CacheS::AddToWeededMPKs</TT> method, which is called by the
<TT>CacheS_DoDeletions</TT> function after it processes every tenth (or
so) MPKFile.
</DL>
<P>

<B>Stable Variables</B><P>

<DL>
<DT>Deleting<DD>
The Deleting file records one of the Boolean values "true" or
"false", indicating whether or not the cache server is processing a
deletion request from the weeder. It is written by the
<TT>CacheS::SetStableDeleting</TT> method, is set to "true" in the
<TT>CacheS::EndMark</TT> method, and is set to "false" in the
<TT>CacheS_DoDeletions</TT> function.<P>

<DT>HitFilter<DD>
The HitFilter is a bit vector recording the cache entries on which
hits should be blocked (so long as they are not leased). It is written
by the <TT>CacheS::WriteHitFilter</TT> method, is set to non-empty
values in the <TT>CacheS::SetHitFilter</TT> and <TT>CacheS::EndMark</TT> methods,
and is set to the empty set in the <TT>CacheS_DoDeletions</TT> function.<P>

<DT>MPKsToWeed<DD>
The MPKsToWeed file records the PKPrefix values of the MultiPKFiles
that have cache entries to be deleted. The file is only relevant if
the stable Deleting variable is true. The file is written by the
<TT>CacheS::SetMPKsToWeed</TT> method during the <TT>CacheS::EndMark</TT>
method. The WeededLog value is interpreted relative to this file as
described above.
</DL>
<P>

<H3><A NAME="CacheTables">Indexing of VPKFiles</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Since PKFiles are organized in the stable cache in groups called
MultiPKFiles, we need a convenient way in the volatile cache for
enumerating the set of VPKFiles stored together in a single
MultiPKFile on the disk.<P>

The way we do this currently is by storing two tables in the volatile
cache:
<UL>
<LI> cache: FP::Tag -&gt; VPKFile*
<LI> mpkTbl: PKPrefix::T -&gt; VMultiPKFile
</UL>
The cache is responsible for maintaining the invariant that any
VPKFile reachable through the <I>cache</I> table is also reachable
through the <I>mpkTbl</I> table. With this organization, we can
enumerate the VPKFile's for a give MultiPKFile simply by iterating
over the appropriate VMultiPKFile in the <I>mpkTbl</I>.<P>

Another approach would be to use a two-level hierarchy for
storing VPKFiles in the volatile cache. The <TT>CacheS</TT> object has a
table <TT>cache: PKPrefix -&gt; VMultiPKFile*</TT>. Each <TT>VMultiPKFile</TT>
then has a table <TT>tbl: FP::Tag -&gt; VPKFile*</TT>.<P>

With this organization, we can enumerate the VPKFiles stored in the
volatile cache under a give PKPrefix (i.e., in the same MultiPKFile)
by simply looking up the VMultiPKFile object stored under the prefix
in <TT>CacheS::cache</TT>, and then iterating over the VPKFile's stored in
the resulting VMultiPKFile. The advantage to this scheme is that it
requires less space and does not require the implementation to
maintain the invariant mentioned earlier. However, this design imposes
two table lookups on every <I>Lookup</I> and <I>AddEntry</I> call.<P>

Yet another design would be to have a single table <TT>cache: FP::Tag
-&gt; VPKFile*</TT> that maps PK's directly to the corresponding VPKFile in
the volatile cache. There would also be a separate table in the CacheS
object <TT>mpkTbl: Prefix -&gt; VPKFile*</TT>. The <TT>mpkTbl</TT> would map a
given prefix to a linked list of VPKFile's in the volatile cache that
share the same prefix. In this implementation, each VPKFile would
contain a pointer to the next VPKFile in the list. The difficulty with
this implementation would be updating the linked list when a VPKFile
was added or removed.

<H3><A NAME="VToSCacheSect">Implementing <TT>VToSCache</TT></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The <TT>VToSCache</TT> function in the cache server specification is
responsible for writing the new entries of a VPKFile to stable
storage. It is also passed a set of the CI's to delete. If any of the
new cache entries in the VPKFile or any of the existing cache entries
in the corresponding SPKFile in stable storage is in this set, the
<TT>VToSCache</TT> function is also responsible for deleting them.<P>

In the implementation, the <TT>VToSCache</TT> function is implemented by
the (surprise!) "<TT>CacheS::VToSCache</TT>" method. However, this method
does very little of the work. Since the disk files correspond to
groups of PKFiles, called <I>MultiPKFiles</I>, it is the volatile
MultiPKFiles that are flushed.  Hence, VToSCache does its work by
calling methods of the "<TT>VMultiPKFile</TT>" and "<TT>SMultiPKFile</TT>"
classes.<P>

The work of re-writing is de-composed into the following steps:<P>

<OL>

<LI> The VMultiPKFile's "<TT>LockForWrite</TT>" method is called to
ensure that the calling thread is the only one that is writing this
MultiPKFile.  It blocks if the MultiPKFile in question is already
being flushed by a different thread.  It also updates the
VMultiPKFile's state to indicate that a flush is in progress, which
protects it from <I>eviction</I> (see "<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#Evictions">Eviction of
VPKFiles and VMultiPKFiles</A>" below).<P>

<LI> "<TT>SMultiPKFile::PrepareForRewrite</TT>" is called to read the
header of the stable MultiPKfile.  The header information is used to
ensure that a VPKFile object exists for each stable PKFile before we
begin the flush to disk.  This is necessary to protect against a
VPKFile being created for one of the stable PKFiles by a client call
during the flush, leaving that VPKFile out of sync with the updates to
the stable PKFile.  (See <A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#UpdatingFreeVars">the discussion of
removal of free variables and updating the <I>commonNames</I> and
<I>uncommonNames</I> sets</A> below.)<P>

<LI> The VMultiPKFile's "<TT>ChkptForWrite</TT>" method is called to
snapshot any new entries to be written to the stable cache, which in
turn calls "<TT>SMultiPKFile::ChkptForRewrite</TT>".  This allows clients
to continue to add new entries in parallel without changing the data
being used by the ongoing flush to disk.<P>

<LI> The CILog and GraphLog are flushed.  This ensures that the
allocations of the cache indicies used by any new entries as well as
their relationships to other entries are committed before writing the
entries themselves to the stable cache.<P>

<LI> The VMultiPKFile's "<TT>ToSCache</TT>" method is called.  However,
this is just a thin wrapper around the "<TT>SMultiPKFile::Rewrite</TT>"
method which does most of the work.<P>

</OL>
<P>

The signature of "<TT>SMultiPKFile::Rewrite</TT>" is:
<PRE>
  void SMultiPKFile::Rewrite(
    const PKPrefix &amp;pfx,
    bool mpkFileExists,
    ifstream &amp;ifs,
    SMultiPKFileRep::Header *hdr,
    const VPKFileMap &amp;vpkFiles,
    ChkPtTbl &amp;vpkChkptTbl,
    const BitVector *toDelete,
    EmptyPKLog *emptyPKLog,
    EntryState &amp;state)
    throw (FS::Failure, FS::EndOfFile, VestaLog::Error);
</PRE>

<DL>

<DT>Its parameters are:<P>

<DD><DL>

<DT><I>pfx</I><DD>
The PK prefix that identifies the MultiPKFile to rewrite.<P>

<DT><I>mpkFileExists</I><DD>
Whether the stable MultiPKFile already exists on disk.  (Taken from
the return value of "<TT>SMultiPKFile::PrepareForRewrite</TT>".)<P>

<DT><I>ifs</I><DD>
An input stream for the old stable MultiPKFile.  (If
<I>mpkFileExists</I> is false, this stream is not open and will not be
used.)<P>

<DT><I>hdr</I><DD>
The header information read from disk by
"<TT>SMultiPKFile::PrepareForRewrite</TT>", or a new empty header is there
is no old stable MultiPKFile.<P>

<DT><I>vpkFiles</I><DD>
A table mapping all PK's with prefix <I>pfx</I> to their corresponding
VPKFiles.  If <I>(pk, vpkfile)</I> is an entry in this table, then
<I>pk</I> has prefix <I>pfx</I>, and hence, corresponds to a PK in the
MultiPKFile in question.  The <I>vpkfile</I> is a pointer to a VPKFile
that may or may not have some new entries that need to be flushed.
Note that the entries in this table <B>must</B> be a superset of the PKs
in the old stable MultiPKFile.<P>

<DT><I>vpkChkptTbl</I><DD>
A table of checkpoints of the VPKFiles in <I>vpkFiles</I>, generated by
calling "<TT>SMultiPKFile::ChkptForRewrite</TT>".<P>

<DT><I>toDelete</I><DD>
A bit vector of cache entry indices (CI's) to delete, or NULL if there
are no entries to delete.<P>

<DT><I>emptyPKLog</I><DD>
The cache server's EmptyPKLog, used to record the pkEpoch values of
PKFile's that become empty during the write (by having all of their
entries deleted and no new entries added).  (See
"<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#CacheLog">Supporting deletions in the CacheLog</A>" below.)<P>

<DT><I>state</I><DD>
Output parameter used to return the changes in the cache server
statistics (number and size of new entries waiting to be flushed to
disk) made by the flush.<P>

</DL>
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="UpdatingFreeVars">By definition of how the common names for a
PKFile are computed, all the entries in an SPKFile have all the common
names. This is not necessarily the case for the entries in a VPKFile.</A><P>

If the set of common names changes, then the common and uncommon
fingerprint tags for all of the entries have to be recomputed, as does
the PKFile's <I>ts</I> value. This can happen for two reasons:<P>

<UL>
<LI>
If there are any <I>newUncommon</I> entries, then some names that used
to be common no longer will be. Hence, this causes the set of common
names to contract.<P>

<LI>
If any entries for the PKFile in question are being deleted, then the
set of common names can expand.
</UL>
<P>

A natural way to represent the changes to the set of common names is
by a pair of bit vectors named <I>exCommonNames</I> and
<I>exUncommonNames</I>. The bits set in the former correspond to names
that were common but are now uncommon, and bits set in the latter
correspond to names that were uncommon but are now common. The
intersection of these two bit vectors will always be empty. Given these
bit vectors, a PKFile's <I>commonNames</I> are updated by code like this:
<PRE>
  commonNames ^= exCommonNames;
  commonNames ^= exUncommonNames;
</PRE>

The <I>uncommonNames</I> set of each of the PKFile's cache entries are
then updated like this:
<PRE>
  uncommonNames -= exUncommonNames;
  uncommonNames |= exCommonNames;
</PRE>

There is another complication: if any entries are deleted, then the
specification says that the set of all free variable names may
contract. This could be a real problem, since the set of common names
for the PKFile and the set of uncommon names for each entry are all
represented by bit vectors interpreted relative to the list of all
free variable names. If that list of names changes, then the bit
vectors have to be packed accordingly. So, the natural algorithm is to
make one pass to determine if any entries are being deleted, and if
so, to test if any names need to be removed from the set of all free
variable names. In that case, a slower path can be taken to convert
the bit vectors.<P>

In the event that any names are removed from the set of all free
variables, the relative order of the names must remain the same. A
natural way to represent the shuffle is by the bit vector of the new
names, called a <I>packMask</I> in the implementation. The operation of
compacting the names corresponds to the operation of <I>packing</I> the
bits in this bit vector. There is an operation defined for the
<TT>BitVector</TT> class that packs a bit vector according to such masks.
Another way of representing the remapping is by a map from the old
index of a name to its new (lower or equal) index. This map is called
<I>reMap</I> in the implementation.<P>

In each cache entry, the <I>commonNames</I> bit vector in each PKFile
and the <I>uncommonNames</I> bit vector in each cache entry must be
packed according to the corresponding <I>packMask</I>. Similarly, the
<I>imap</I> in the "extras" portion of each entry that maps indices in
the list of all free variables to indices in the fingerprint and
timestamp arrays must be modified to correspond to the new list of all
variable names. This is easily done using the <I>reMap</I> table.<P>

Since there are both packed and unpacked versions of various bit
vectors and maps when a PKFile is updated, care must be taken to avoid
comparing or combining packed and unpacked values. In general, value
packing is delayed to the end of the major methods, so most operations
are performed on unpacked values.<P>

In the specification, the VToSCache work is divided into roughly two
functions:<P>

<DL>
<DT>NewPF<DD>
Computes the entries in the stable PKFile. This includes adding any new
entries from the volatile PKFile and deleting any entries in the
<I>hitFilter</I>.<P>

<DT>NewVF<DD>
Computes the entries in the volatile PKFile.
</DL>
<P>

Roughly speaking, there is a function in the implementation
corresponding to each of these functions in the specification. The
correspondence between them is:<P>

<UL>
<LI> <TT>SVCache.NewPF</TT> is implemented by <TT>SPKFile::Update</TT>
<LI> <TT>SVCache.NewVF</TT> is implemented by <TT>VPKFile::Update</TT>
</UL>
<P>

The <TT>SPKFile::Update</TT> method computes and returns the
<I>exCommonNames</I>, <I>exUncommonNames</I>, <I>packMask</I>, and
<I>reMap</I> values that result from updating a particular PKFile. These
values are salted away by the <TT>SMultiPKFile::Rewrite</TT> method in an
<TT>SMultiPKFileRep::HeaderEntry</TT> structure for that PKFile. The
values are then passed into the <TT>VPKFile::Update</TT> method (along
with the checkpoint) so the VPKFile can be updated to be consistent
with the stable PKFile.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="CacheLog">Supporting deletions in the CacheLog</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Butler's original SVCache specification has the following bug: it does not
correctly handle the case where some entries are created (and hence
written to the CacheLog) and then subsequently deleted. If the cache
server crashes at this point without the CacheLog having been cleaned
in the meantime, the deleted entries will be read from the CacheLog
and installed in the cache!<P>

To avoid this problem (and to simplify the process of cleaning the
CacheLog), we assign a <I>pkEpoch</I> field to each stable and volatile
PKFile, and to each entry in the CacheLog. A new SPKFile or VPKFile
has a pkEpoch of 0. Whenever a new entry is created, it is written to
the CacheLog with the pkEpoch of its corresponding VPKFile. Whenever a
VPKFile is "flushed" to the stable cache, the pkEpoch of the VPKFile
is incremented before the SPKFile is written to disk. Hence, the
pkEpoch values of all entries in a SPKFile are strictly less than the
pkEpoch of the SPKFile itself, and at recovery (or in the
CleanCacheLog procedure) any entry in the CacheLog with a pkEpoch
strictly less than that of the corresponding SPKFile should be
discarded.<P>

Other entries in the CacheLog, and each VPKFile in memory,
usually have a pkEpoch value equal to that of the corresponding
SPKFile on disk.  There are two exceptions:<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Flushing a VPKFile to the stable cache is not an atomic operation;
more entries can be created and logged (or deleted) between the time
when the cache server decides what version of the VPKFile will be made
stable and the time when the new MultiPKFile containing the updated
SPKFile is fully written and atomically replaces the old one on disk.
The cache server atomically snapshots a particular state of the
VPKFile to be written to disk by making a "checkpoint" of it, and the
checkpoint determines what will actually be written to disk,
regardless of later changes to the VPKFile.  Because any entries not
in the checkpoint will not be flushed at this time, the VPKFile's pkEpoch
must be incremented atomically with making the checkpoint.  Thus the new
version of the SPKFile will have the correct pkEpoch, and any entries
created after the checkpoint is made will also have this epoch, as they
should.  (Minor detail: the implementation actually writes the old
value of pkEpoch to the checkpoint data structure, but correctly uses the
incremented value when writing the SPKFile to disk.)<P>

Note that after the VPKFile has been checkpointed but before the
stable MultiPKFile has been written, any new entries that are written
to the CacheLog for that PKFile will have a pkEpoch value greater than
that of the SPKFile, not equal to it.  If the cache server crashes
before the MultiPKFile has been written, this difference will be
visible at recovery time.  (If the cache server crashes repeatedly,
the difference can be more than 1.)  During recovery, it is important
to recover this larger pkEpoch value and restore it to the VPKFile
data structure; we do so by noticing when a cacheLog entry being
recovered has a larger pkEpoch value than we have seen so far for the
corresponding VPKFile and updating the latter accordingly.<P>

It would also be possible for the VPKFile and SPKFile's pkEpochs to
differ by more than 1 if there were several flushes in progress at the
same time, since starting each flush takes a checkpoint and increments
the volatile pkEpoch by 1.  However, this scenario is prevented
because VMultiPKFile::ToSCache refuses to flush the same MultiPKFile
twice concurrently.  To be extra careful, though, the cache records a
VPKFile's pkEpoch when checkpointing it, and when writing out the
SPKFile from the checkpoint, it asserts that vpkfile-&gt;pkEpoch ==
chkpt-&gt;pkEpoch+1.<P>

Finally, we introduce an extra complication to make epoch numbers grow
more slowly.  Because all VPKFiles in a MultiPKFile must be
checkpointed when the MultiPKFile is flushed, all their pkEpochs must
be incremented at this time as well.  However, modifications are not
necessarily made to all of the corresponding SPKFiles. To prevent the
pkEpoch of an SPKFile from being incremented unnecessarily, the
VPKFile pkEpoch is decremented back to its original value when the new
SMultiPKFile is committed whenever it is safe to do so, namely when
the SPKFile is deemed not to have been modified <I>and</I> when no new
entries were created (with the incremented pkEpoch value) since the
VPKFile was checkpointed.  (This decrementing and the code used to
determine whether it is safe also depends for their validity on the fact
that the same PKFile cannot be flushed twice concurrently, so there
can be only one checkpoint in existence at a time.)<P>

<LI>
Another case that causes difficulties occurs when all of the entries
are deleted from a SPKFile. In this case, no record of the SPKFile is
kept in the stable cache, so if the cache server were to crash, the
SPKFile would be found to have a pkEpoch of 0 at recovery time. In
that case, there could be entries in the CacheLog with arbitrarily large
pkEpoch values, and they would be incorrectly kept. The problem is
that there is no way to distinguish this case from the one in which we
are starting a fresh, empty cache server with no history.<P>

To handle this case, we keep a second log called the <I>EmptyPKLog</I>
that records when a SPKFile has become empty. We also record the new
pkEpoch for that (empty) SPKFile in the EmptyPKLog. At <I>VToSCache</I>
time, we must commit these log records <I>before</I> swinging the file
pointer for the SMultiPKFile (or deleting the SMultiPKFile entirely if
all its SPKFile's are now empty). If the cache server crashes after
committing a EmptyPKLog record, but before committing the new
SMultiPKFile, it will have a record at recovery indicating that a
PKFile has been deleted when in fact it has not. The recovery process
must be able to handle this case.<P>

At recovery, we first read the EmptyPKLog, building a table that maps
PK's to the highest pkEpoch for that PK in the log. Once we have
built the table, we scan the CacheLog. For each record in the
CacheLog, we compare the pkEpoch of the entry to the pkEpoch of the
SPKFile in the stable cache. If there is no such SPKFile, we look in
the table of empty PKFiles and read the pkEpoch from there. If there
is no such entry in the table, we use a pkEpoch of 0. Now, if the
pkEpoch of the entry is less than that of the (possibly empty) PKFile,
we ignore it. Otherwise, we add the entry to the volatile cache.<P>

When a new VPKFile is created, its pkEpoch is usually initialized to
that of the corresponding SPKFile. However, if the SPKFile has been
deleted, it is important to initialize the VPKFile's pkEpoch to be
that of the entry in the EmptyPKLog. (Otherwise, we would initialize
it to 0. This would be wrong if there were old cache log entries for
the VPKFile, since they might be erroneously recovered.) So as to
avoid having to read the EmptyPKLog whenever a new VPKFile is created,
we keep the table of empty PK files read at recovery time permanently,
and consult it whenever a new VPKFile is created. The cache server
maintains the invariant that the table consists of the maximum pkEpoch
values of the entries in the EmptyPKLog. It does this by augmenting
the table whenever a new EmptyPKLog entry is written.
</UL>
<P>

The <I>CleanCacheLog</I> procedure re-writes both the CacheLog and the
EmptyPKLog, removing unnecessary entries from both. Unlike the
recovery process, it does not read the EmptyPKLog from disk because
that log's entries are already stored in its in-memory table. Like the
recovery process, however, it reads through the entries in the
CacheLog. Any entry in the CacheLog with a pkEpoch less than that
specified by the corresponding stable PKFile or entry in the empty PK
table is discarded; all others are copied to the new version of the log.<P>

Once the new CacheLog is written, there is no reason to save any
entries in the EmptyPKLog (or its corresponding in-memory table) that
were inserted before the start of cleaning: (1) A CacheLog entry that
survived cleaning certainly does not need to be compared against the
same old EmptyPKLog entries again. (2) A CacheLog entry added after
the start of cleaning certainly cannot need to be discarded because
its PKFile was deleted before the start of cleaning.<P>

We delete old entries from the EmptyPKLog by starting a checkpoint of
the log at the beginning of cleaning, writing nothing to it, and
committing it at the end of cleaning.  (We never write anything to an
EmptyPKLog checkpoint.)  Thus new entries can accumulate in the
EmptyPKLog during cleaning, but entries from before cleaning disappear
when the checkpoint commits.  Handling the in-memory copy of the
EmptyPKLog is slightly more complicated.  The EmptyPKLog class keeps
two separate tables during cleaning, one for old entries and one for
new ones.  Lookups examine both tables.  At the end of cleaning, the
old table is freed.<P>

Because the CacheLog and EmptyPKLog are separate logs, we can't commit
changes to both logs atomically, so we have to use careful ordering
instead.  It is harmless if we fail to delete some old entries from
the EmptyPKLog that could have been deleted, so we use the following
ordering: (1) Begin EmptyPKLog checkpoint, (2) Begin CacheLog
checkpoint, (3) Clean CacheLog, (4) Commit CacheLog checkpoint, (5)
Commit EmptyPKLog checkpoint.

<H3><A NAME="Evictions">Eviction of VPKFiles and VMultiPKFiles</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The original cache server design did not include any mechanism for
removing VPKFiles and VMultiPKFiles from memory.  Once these data
structures were created, they existed for the lifetime of the cache
server.  The consequence of this was that a certain portion of the
cache server's memory usage was monotonically increasing over time.<P>

However, due to the multi-threaded nature of the cache server,
removing these data structures from the cache is not straightforward.
If another thread were still using a VPKFile that had been removed,
data could be lost (e.g. a newly added cache entry).  This section
describes the methods used to avoid these problems and implement
<I>eviction</I> of VPKFiles and VMultiPKFiles.<P>

Each VPKFile has a boolean "<TT>evicted</TT>" member variable.  This is
set to <B>false</B> when the VPKFile is created, and becomes <B>true</B>
when the VPKFile is evicted from the cache.  When a thread locks a
VPKFile, before using it in any way, it is responsible for first
checking to make sure that it hasn't been evicted.  This is necessary
because there is an implicit race between the thread responsible for
evicting VPKFiles and any thread using a VPKFile.  This test is
implemented as follows:
<PRE>
  // Lock the VPKFile we're about to use
  vpkfile-&gt;mu.lock();

  // Ensure that we don't have an evicted VPKFile
  while(vpkfile-&gt;Evicted())
    {
      // Unlock the evicted one, as we won't be using it
      vpkfile-&gt;mu.unlock();

      // Get another VPKFile object for this PK (probably
      // creating it)
      CacheS.mu.lock();
      (void)(CacheS.GetVPKFile(pk, /*OUT*/ vpkfile));
      CacheS.mu.unlock();

      // Lock our new VPKFile object
      vpkfile-&gt;mu.lock();
    }

  // ...proceed with using the VPKFile...
</PRE>

Each VPKFile also has a <I>freeing epoch</I> ("<TT>freePKFileEpoch</TT>").
Each time a VPKFile is used by a client call (FreeVariables, Lookup,
or AddEntry), this is updated to the current value of a global counter
("<TT>CacheS.freeMPKFileEpoch</TT>").  Only VPKFiles that have not been
used for a configurable amount of time (i.e. have a sufficiently low
freeing epoch) are potential candidates for eviction.  This is done to
avoid evicting VPKFiles that have had recent activity, as uses of a
given PK have a degree of temporal locality.<P>

The process of evicting VPKFiles and VMultiPKFiles is handled by the
same background thread which periodically flushes new entries to disk
(implemented by the "<TT>CacheS_DoFreeMPKFiles</TT>" function).  After new
entries have been flushed to disk and old entries have been purged
from memory, it searches for VPKFiles to evict.  A VPKFile is evicted
if and only if:<P>

<UL>

<LI>
It has not been used recently by a client call (it has a sufficiently
old freeing epoch).<P>

<LI>
It has no new entries yet to be flushed to the stable cache.<P>

<LI>
It currently has no old ("warm") entries paged in from the stable
cache.<P>

<LI>
It is not part of a VMultiPKFile that is currently being
<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#VToSCacheSect">flushed to the stable cache</A> or that is going to
be flushed to the stable cache in the near future.<P>

</UL>
<P>

A VPKFile is evicted by calling its "<TT>Evict</TT>" method (which simply
sets its "<TT>evicted</TT>" member variable to <B>true</B>), removing it
from the table of VPKFiles ("<TT>CacheS.cache</TT>"), and removing it from
its VMultiPKFile's table of subordinate VPKFiles.  (See
"<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#CacheTables">Indexing of VPKFiles</A>" above.)<P>

After evicting VPKFiles, VMultiPKFiles may be evicted.  A VMultiPKFile
is evicted if and only if:<P>

<UL>

<LI>
It has zero subordinate VPKFiles.  (Thus, for a VMultiPKFile to be
evicted, all of its VPKFiles must first be evicted.)<P>

<LI>
It is neither currently being <A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#VToSCacheSect">flushed to the
stable cache</A> nor is going to be flushed to the stable cache in the
near future.<P>

</UL>
<P>

A VMultiPKFile is evicted simply by removing it from the table of
VMultiPKFiles ("<TT>CacheS.mpkTbl</TT>").<P>

Note that, unlike VPKFiles, VMultiPKFiles do not have a member
variable indicating whether they have been evicted.  This means that
if a thread holds a pointer to a VMultiPKFile, it could be evicted out
from under it.  However, the only case where this can happen is during
"<A HREF="VCacheImpl.7.html#VToSCacheSect"><TT>CacheS::VToSCache</TT></A>", in which case the
VMultiPKFile is protected against eviction.  This is why, in the
implementation of "<TT>CacheS::VToSCache</TT>", the cache lock
("<TT>CacheS.mu</TT>") is held from before the pointer to the VMultiPKFile
is acquired until after the VMultiPKFile is locked for writing (by
calling "<TT>VMultiPKFile::LockForWrite</TT>").<P>

Also note that, as of this writing, VMultiPKFiles that are to be
re-written to process pending deletions (i.e. are in MPKsToWeed) are
not protected from eviction, nor are their subordinate VPKFiles.  It
might be nice to protect them from eviction, but currently MPKsToWeed
is an unordered list of PK prefixes, which means that determining
whether a given MultiPKFile is in the set would require a linear
search.  However, protecting these VMultiPKFiles and VPKFiles from
eviction is not strictly necessary, as the other constraints on
eviction are sufficient to maintain correct behavior of the cache.<P>

Finally, the entire eviction design is predicated on the cache server
use of garbage collection.  Pointers to the evicted VPKFiles and
VMultiPKFiles are simply dropped.  This allows other threads time to
deal with evicted VPKFiles.  Eventually, the garbage collector will
reclaim the space used by the evicted objects.
