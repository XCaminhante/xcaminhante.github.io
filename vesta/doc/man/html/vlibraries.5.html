This man page describes the organization of libraries in the standard
Vesta-2 building environment. In particular, it documents the
<TT>common/std_env/18</TT> and <TT>common/cxx/14</TT> packages (presumably,
later versions of these packages will conform to this man page as
well).<P>

The standard environment defines a collection of hierarchically
arranged libraries. The leaves of this hierarchy are called,
appropriately, <I>leaf libraries</I>. The non-leaves are called
<I>umbrella libraries</I>.<P>

Each package exports a single library, although it is quite possible
for a package to export an umbrella library one of whose children is
defined in the same package (see the "<TT>vesta/basics</TT>" package, for
example). As a result, there is <I>not</I> a one-to-one correspondence
between library packages and libraries. This point is important for
understanding the distinction between how library packages are named
and how the libraries themselves are named.<P>

In order to make it easy for the client of a library to arrange
for it to be built suitably, the system model for a library
doesn't actually build the library. Rather, it invokes a bridge function
("<TT>leaf</TT> or <TT>umbrella</TT>) that simply records the parts that make up
the library. (The parts of a leaf library are header files and
source code files; the parts of an umbrella library are the other
libraries of which it is composed.) The results of these libraries are
called <I>library descriptions</I>, and they correspond to the Vesta-2
type <A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LibDesc"><TT>LibDesc</TT></A> and its three subtypes:
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LeafLibDesc"><TT>LeafLibDesc</TT></A>,
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#UmbrellaLibDesc"><TT>UmbrellaLibDesc</TT></A>, and
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#PrebuiltLibDesc"><TT>PrebuiltLibDesc</TT></A>.<P>

When the client actually uses a particular set of libraries to build a
program, the necessary pieces are built. (Of course, in many cases,
the Vesta caching machinery makes the build fast.)<P>

Because the construction of libraries is delayed as long as
possible, the client can influence the building process. For
example, the client can:<P>

<UL>
<LI>
control which libraries are included in an umbrella,
<LI>
override the specific versions of
libraries used at all levels of the hierarchy, and
<LI>
set the compilation switches used when the library is built (e.g., to
enable debugging).
</UL>
<P>

For more information about how to build a library with overrides, see
the <A HREF="voverrides.5.html">voverrides(5)</A> man page.

As previously described, libraries are arranged in a hierarchy. The
leaves of the hierarchy are called leaf libraries, and the internal
nodes of the hierarchy are called umbrella libraries.<P>

To override the way a library or some part of a library is built, you
must provide a name for the library. There are two styles used
for naming libraries: <I>flat</I> and <I>hierarchical</I>. If flat naming is
being used, then all library names are assumed to be unique; the hierarchy of
umbrellas isn't used to name libraries.<P>

The standard construction environment provides support for both flat
and hierarchical library naming. Which naming scheme is used for a
particular bridge depends on the value of the
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeOptions"><TT>flat_lib_names</TT></A>" bridge
option. If that value is true, flat naming is used; if it is false,
hierarchical naming is used.<P>

Hierarchical naming is desirable if the number of leaf libraries is so
large that there is likely to be a naming conflict, i.e., that two or
more leaf libraries will have the same name. That is certainly
allowed, but if the library name space were flat, it would be
impossible to name a particular leaf library uniquely for overriding
purposes. Hence, you can build your program using hierarchical naming,
in which cases the overrides specifications are themselves
hierarchical. Here are the details.<P>

If flat library naming is used, libraries in a library override are
named by a single text corresponding to the the name provided to the
"<TT>leaf</TT>" or "<TT>umbrella</TT>" call that creates the library. This is
the simplest way to name a library, but it requires that all libraries
have distinct names. In particular, it does not allow two different
leaf libraries in different umbrella libraries to have the same name.<P>

If hierarchical naming is used, library overrides are bindings, and
the libraries named by such a binding correspond to paths
in that binding. The internal nodes of the override binding are the
names of umbrella libraries. For example, if the leaf library
"<TT>libBasics.a</TT>" is part of the umbrella library
"<TT>libBasicsUmb</TT>", which in turn was part of the umbrella library
"<TT>libVestaUmb</TT>", the overrides "<TT>ovs</TT>" for the leaf would be
specified by a binding of the form:
<PRE>
[ libVestaUmb = [ libBasicsUmb = [ libBasics.a = ovs ] ] ];
</PRE>

Using hierarchical names, it is possible for a single library override
to effect multiple umbrella and leaf libraries. See the type
"<A HREF="vlibraries.5.html#NamedLibOvs"><TT>NamedLibOvs</TT></A>" for more details about the
form taken by library overrides.
