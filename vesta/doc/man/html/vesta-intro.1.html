Vesta is a system for software configuration management.
It consists of a source code storage and control component,
comprising the <I>repository</I> and <I>repository tools</I>,
and a building component, comprising
the <I>evaluator</I>, the <I>function cache</I>, and the <I>weeder</I>.
For an overview, see the paper
<A HREF="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/abstracts/src-rr-168.html"><I>The Vesta Approach to Software Configuration Management</I></A>,

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="repository">repository</A><DD> The Vesta <I>repository</I> is responsible for
long-term data storage in files and directories.  It acts as an NFS
file server, making all source code stored in Vesta visible in the
ordinary file name space.  See <A HREF="repository.8.html"><B>repository</B>(8)</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="repository_tools">repository tools</A><DD> The repository has several special features
not shared by ordinary NFS servers, which are accessible through the
command line tools referenced below.  Many of the standard Vesta
conventions and policies are implemented in the tools, not in the
repository proper, making them relatively easy to change.
The documentation for each tool is referenced under
<A HREF="vesta-intro.1.html#See_Also">See Also</A> below.<P>

<DT><A NAME="immutable">immutable</A><DD> All source code permanently stored by the repository
is <I>immutable</I>; that is, it cannot be modified.  Once a filename is
bound to a particular file, that file cannot be edited or replaced
with a different file.  This feature supports reproducible building
and simplifies both source replication and build caching.<P>

<DT><A NAME="version">version</A><DD> By convention, every file permanently stored in the
repository has a <I>version number</I> somewhere in its name.  Thus,
although each file is immutable, the repository can represent an
evolving program as a sequence of files with different version
numbers.<P>

<DT><A NAME="package">package</A><DD> We have found it convenient to organize sources into
<I>packages</I>.  A package is a tree of files and directories that
typically change together.  The Vesta repository tools do versioning
at the package level, not the level of individual files: each package
is a sequence of versions.  For example,
<TT>/vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/repos/74/src/RepositoryMain.C</TT>
is one of the files in version 74 of the package named
<TT>/vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/repos</TT>.
The <A HREF="vcreate.1.html"><B>vcreate</B>(1)</A> tool creates a package.<P>

<DT><A NAME="branch">branch</A><DD> The versions of a package are numbered in a linear
sequence.  To represent forked or parallel development, the repository
tools support the concept of a <I>branch</I>.  A branch is a new package
that is placed as a subdirectory of the parent package, with a name
based on one of the versions of the parent package (the branch base),
and with a version 0 that is identical to the branch base.
The <A HREF="vbranch.1.html"><B>vbranch</B>(1)</A> tool creates a branch.<P>

<DT><A NAME="appendable_directory">appendable directory</A><DD> An <I>appendable directory</I> is a
directory in which new names can be inserted, but existing names
cannot be deleted and reused.  Packages are stored in a tree of
appendable directories that is conventionally mounted as <TT>/vesta</TT>.
Each package is itself an appendable directory so that new versions
can be added.<P>

<DT><A NAME="immutable_directory">immutable directory</A><DD> An <I>immutable directory</I> is a directory
that cannot be changed at all; names can neither be created nor
deleted.  A package version is stored as a tree of immutable directories.<P>

<DT><A NAME="immutable_file">immutable file</A><DD>  An <I>immutable file</I> is a file whose contents
cannot be changed.  The files in a package version are immutable.<P>

<DT><A NAME="mutable_attributes">mutable attributes</A><DD> A source object's <I>mutable attributes</I>
are a set of (name, value) pairs that the repository attaches to the
object.  The repository tools use mutable attributes to store
many kinds of information; for example, when and by whom a package was
created, and on what previous versions a new version was based.
The <A HREF="vattrib.1.html"><B>vattrib</B>(1)</A> tool can be used to
view or modify mutable attributes.<P>

<DT><A NAME="mutable_directory">mutable directory</A><DD> A <I>mutable directory</I> is a directory
implemented by the repository that looks much like an ordinary
filesystem directory; files and subdirectories in such a directory can
be freely created, deleted, or edited.  Mutable directories are
stored in a tree that is conventionally mounted as <TT>/vesta-work</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="mutable_file">mutable file</A><DD> A <I>mutable file</I> is a file in a mutable
directory.  Internally, a mutable file may be implemented as a link to
an immutable file, with copy-on-write if a user attempts to edit the
file, but this detail is not visible through the NFS interface.<P>

<DT><A NAME="base">base</A><DD> The repository can quickly create a mutable directory that
is <I>based on</I> (initialized from) any immutable directory.<P>

<DT><A NAME="snapshot">snapshot</A><DD> The repository can quickly create an immutable
directory that is a <I>snapshot</I> (immutable copy) of any mutable directory.<P>

<DT><A NAME="working_directory">working directory</A><DD>  A <I>working directory</I> is a mutable
directory created for the purpose of editing sources and developing
new package versions.  It may either be initially empty or based on
a previous package version.<P>

<DT><A NAME="checkout">checkout</A><DD> To <I>check out</I> a package means to initiate
development of the package's next version.  The repository tools use a
locking (pessimistic) concurrency control model, so the next version
number is reserved at checkout time.  The
<A HREF="vcheckout.1.html"><B>vcheckout</B>(1)</A> tool is used to check out a
package.  By default, it creates a working directory based on the
most recent previous package version.  It also creates a session
directory and a reservation stub, described next.<P>

<DT><A NAME="session">session</A><DD> Because the Vesta evaluator (builder)
can operate only on
immutable sources, Vesta users end up creating a large number of
versions, most of which are of little long-term interest.  For
example, each attempt to modify and recompile a program will generate a
new version. Typically many of these versions will have syntax errors or
other simple bugs.  We have therefore found it convenient to
distinguish between two kinds of package versions: <I>public versions</I>,
which a developer typically creates when he is ready to release code
for use by others, and <I>session versions</I>, in-between versions
created during development and debugging.  A <I>session directory</I>
holds session versions.  For example, the versions in the development
session that led up to the creation of version
<TT>/vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/repos/74</TT> appear in the session
directory <TT>/vesta/src.dec.com/vesta/repos/checkout/74</TT>, under
the names <TT>0</TT>, <TT>1</TT>, <TT>2</TT>, etc.<P>

<DT><A NAME="advance">advance</A><DD> To <I>advance</I> a session means to create the
next session version, by making a snapshot of the working directory
and placing it in the session directory.
The <A HREF="vadvance.1.html"><B>vadvance</B>(1)</A> tool handles this task.<P>

<DT><A NAME="stub">stub</A><DD> A <I>stub</I> is an object that can appear in the repository
name space as a placeholder.  A stub is manifested through the NFS
interface as an empty file with unusual access permissions (details below).<P>

<DT><A NAME="reservation_stub">reservation stub</A><DD> A <I>reservation stub</I> is a stub created by
the checkout tool as a placeholder to reserve the next package version
number.  On a reservation stub, all the read and execute permissions
are turned off, but the setuid bit is turned on. The write permissions
are meaningful, so they are allowed to show through. Thus a reservation
stub will typically appear in an "ls -l" listing with mode
<TT>--wS------</TT> or <TT>--wS-w----</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="checkin">checkin</A><DD> To <I>check in</I> a package means to create a new public
version.  The <A HREF="vcheckin.1.html"><B>vcheckin</B>(1)</A> tool handles
this task.  It works by replacing the reservation stub created at
checkout time with a copy of the last version in the session
directory.  Checkin also ends the session by deleting the working directory.<P>

<DT><A NAME="ghost">ghost</A><DD> Although names in appendable directories can never be
deleted and reused for different objects, the repository does support
a limited form of deletion.  A <I>ghost</I> is a placeholder for an
object that has been deleted.  The ghost preserves the knowledge that
its name was used for a real (non-ghost) object in the past and must
not be used for a different object in the future.  A ghost can safely
be replaced with an exact copy of the deleted object if one can be
found, but it is otherwise unchangeable and cannot be deleted.  A ghost
is manifested through the NFS interface as an empty file with all
access permissions turned off and the sticky bit turned on, so "ls -l"
will show <TT>---------T</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="replication">replication</A><DD> Conceptually, all objects in all
Vesta repositories are named in one large hierarchical namespace
rooted at <TT>/vesta</TT>.  (We exclude mutable and volatile directories here.)
Each repository may contain some subtree of the global namespace.
<I>Replication</I> exists when the subtrees stored at two or more
repositories overlap.  The <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Vesta_Replication">Vesta
Replication</A> section in the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> man
page explains replication in more detail.<P>

<DT><A NAME="agreement">agreement</A><DD> Roughly speaking, in the presence of replication, one or
more repositories <I>agree</I> (are consistent) if (1) there are no cases
where the same name means something different in two different
repositories, and (2) each name is marked as master in at most one
repository.  Agreement is a somewhat subtle concept that is explained
more fully in the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Vesta_Replication">Vesta Replication</A>
section of the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> man page, and
defined precisely in <I>Vesta: A System for Software Configuration
Management</I>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="master">master</A><DD> Each object under <TT>/vesta</TT> has a boolean <I>master</I> flag.
Mastership is used for several purposes, explained more fully in
the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html#Vesta_Replication">Vesta Replication</A>
section of the <A HREF="vrepl.1.html"><B>vrepl</B>(1)</A> man page.<P>

<DT><A NAME="master_stub">master stub</A><DD>  A stub whose master flag is true.
A reservation stub is always a master stub.<P>

<DT><A NAME="symlink-to">symlink-to</A><DD> The repository stores symbolic links in a somewhat
odd way, as stubs or ghosts with the mutable attribute <TT>symlink-to</TT>.
The value of this attribute is the link value.  This detail is not
visible through the NFS interface, but is mentioned in the man
pages for some of the repository tools.<P>

<DT><A NAME="nonmaster_stub">nonmaster stub</A><DD> A stub whose master flag is false.  A nonmaster
stub is used as a placeholder for an object that may exist in some
repository, but is not replicated locally.  On a non-master stub, all
permissions are turned off, but the setgid bit is turned on, so "ls
-l" will show <TT>------S---</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="SDL">SDL</A><DD> The Vesta <I>software description language</I> is a specialized
language used to describe how to build a software system from its
components.  It includes native data structures suited for
representing files and directories, a primitive for invoking
external tools like compilers and linkers, and general-purpose
language features such as functions, conditionals, arithmetic, lists,
and string manipulation.
See <A HREF="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/technical-notes/abstracts/src-tn-1997-005.html"><I>The Vesta-2 Software Description Language</I></A>, also
available as an appendix in <I>Vesta: A System for Software Configuration Management</I>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="model">model</A><DD>  A <I>model</I> or <I>system model</I> 
is a program written in the Vesta SDL.<P>

<DT><A NAME="import">import</A><DD> The Vesta SDL is modular; the description of a large software
system can be broken up into many different models.  One model uses
another by <I>importing</I> it.<P>

<DT><A NAME="standard_construction_environment">standard construction environment</A><DD> The <I>standard construction
environment</I> is a standard set of build tools (such as compilers and
linkers), libraries, and header files.  User-written models gain
access to this environment by importing a Vesta-provided model that
describes it.  For example, the standard construction 
environment models that are used to build Vesta on Red Hat i686 Linux come
from the package <TT>/vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i686/std_env</TT>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="evaluator">evaluator</A><DD>  The <I>evaluator</I> is an interpreter for the
Vesta SDL.  See <A HREF="vesta.1.html"><B>vesta</B>(1)</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="runtool_server">runtool server</A><DD>  The <I>runtool server</I> is a server process
that runs on each Vesta client machine.  It assists the evaluator
in invoking external tools like compilers and linkers.  See 
<A HREF="RunToolServer.1.html"><B>RunToolServer</B>(1)</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="function_cache">function cache</A><DD> The <I>function cache</I> is a central server that
stably caches the results of past Vesta evaluations in order to speed up
future evaluations.  See <A HREF="VCache.1.html"><B>VCache</B>(1)</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="weeder">weeder</A><DD> The <I>weeder</I> deletes material from the function
cache that is no longer wanted, in order to free up disk space.
See <A HREF="VestaWeed.1.html"><B>VestaWeed</B>(1)</A>.<P>

<DT><A NAME="volatile_directory">volatile directory</A><DD> <I>Volatile directories</I> allow tools
started by the evaluator to view Vesta bindings as filesystem
directories, with the changes the tools make recorded by the
repository and available to the evaluator.  The volatile directory
tree is conventionally mounted under <TT>/vesta-work/.volatile</TT>.
It should normally never be accessed directly by users, to avoid
creating false dependencies in ongoing evaluations.

<H3><A NAME="ConfigFiles">Configuration Files</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Most Vesta tools use a standard mechanism for
determining configuration information about a Vesta installation.
This mechanism attempts to locate a configuration file named
<I>vesta.cfg</I> by searching in a number of locations. The 
<A HREF="vgetconfig.1.html"><B>vgetconfig</B>(1)</A> man page
describes a command-line interface for determining the location of the
configuration file and for printing the value of a particular
configuration variable. The meanings of the configuration variables
recognized by the various tools are documented in their individual man
pages.<P>

For information on configuration file location and syntax, see the
<A HREF="vesta.cfg.5.html"><B>vesta.cfg</B>(5)</A> man page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="Name_Interpretation">Name Interpretation</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Although the names that you can give on the command line to a Vesta
repository tool look like filenames, they have somewhat different
properties, because they must be looked up directly in the
repository, not in the local filesystem.<P>

First, if a name is unqualified (does not have "<TT>/</TT>", "<TT>.</TT>", or
"<TT>..</TT>" as its first arc), it is usually qualified by prepending an
appropriate default directory name, as explained in the individual
documentation for each tool.<P>

Next, a name that does not begin with "<TT>/</TT>" is handled by asking the
system for the absolute name of the current working directory (using
the <B>getcwd</B>(3) library routine) and prepending the string that is
returned.  This is the only case where the state of the local
filesystem matters.<P>

Next, the name is textually processed to remove "<TT>.</TT>", empty, and
"<TT>..</TT>" arcs.  Note that we do not check whether an arc cancelled
out by "<TT>..</TT>" actually exists in the repository.<P>

Finally, a name that begins with <TT>/vesta</TT> or
<I>[UserInterface]AppendableRootName</I> is looked up in the
appendable part of the repository.  Usually the default local
repository is used, but some of the tools have command line options to
let you specify a different repository, and some will automatically
find the master copy or another copy of the specified source, as
explained in their individual documentation.  Similarly, a name that
begins with <TT>/vesta-work</TT> or <I>[UserInterface]MutableRootName</I> is
always looked up in the mutable part of the default local repository.
It makes no difference whether the default repository (or even
some other repository) is NFS mounted on the machine where you run the
command.<P>

Any name that does not begin with one of the recognized prefixes
is rejected with the error message "not in the Vesta repository".<P>

Note that symbolic links are not expanded during this name processing
and are not understood by the repository.  Thus, for example,
the command "<TT>vcheckout -o latest foo/bar</TT>" will not use the
latest version of foo/bar as the old version; it will attempt to
use the "latest" link itself as the old version, which will not work.
