<H3><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The existing bridge and standard environment models provide a wide
variety of mechanisms for building Vesta-2 models with various forms of
overrides. This note describes those mechanisms, and gives examples of
their most common usage. In particular, it documents the
<TT>common/std_env/18</TT> and <TT>common/cxx/14</TT> packages (presumably,
later versions of these packages will conform to this man page as well).<P>

There are two general classes of overrides: <I>transient</I> and
<I>permanent</I>.<P>

Transient overrides are specified through the Vesta control panel for
a particular purpose at hand. For example, they include building a
program against a locally checked-out version of a library, or
building a package with profiling enabled. Since we currently don't
have a Vesta control panel application, practically speaking,
transient overrides are made by modifying a package's "<TT>.main.ves</TT>"
file. The changes made to that file are transient because they are not
visible to clients that import the package.<P>

Permanent overrides, on the other hand, are made to the visible models
of a package. Permanent overrides take precedence over transient
overrides, so they should only be made if they are absolutely
necessary to building the package correctly. For example, in compiling
the C source files of a particular package, it might be necessary to
include a macro definition on the command-line to the compiler.<P>

The rest of this man page is divided into sections describing
different kinds of overrides, showing examples of their use. It may
help to be familiar with the <A HREF="vtypes.5.html">vtypes(5)</A> man page,
which describes the Vesta-2 types used in the <TT>std_env</TT> and
<TT>cxx</TT> models, although the HTML version of this document contains
many links to portions of that man page.<P>

<H3><A NAME="OverrideTypes">General vs. Named Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There are two mechanisms for overriding, which work quite
differently:<P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="GeneralOverride"><I>General Overrides</I></A><P>

<DD>An override may be expressed as a binding (possibly with other
bindings as substructure) whose shape resembles a portion of the
standard environment. If "<TT>.</TT>" is the environment and
"<TT>ovs</TT>" is a general override, then at some appropriate point in
the building process, the statement:
<PRE>
. ++= ovs;
</PRE>

is executed.  The resulting environment is then used for the portion of
the building process to which the override "<TT>ovs</TT>" applies.
In this particular case, "<TT>ovs</TT>" will be of type 
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>".<P>

Sometimes, the overrides "<TT>ovs</TT>" is applied to a <I>part</I> of the
standard environment. One common case is when a particular bridge of
the standard environment is overridden. This is accomplished by the
statement:
<PRE>
. ++= [ $bridge = ovs ];
</PRE>

In this particular case, "<TT>ovs</TT>" will be of type 
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeOvs"><TT>BridgeOvs</TT></A>".<P>

<DT><A NAME="NamedOverride"><I>Named Overrides</I></A><P>

<DD>An override may be expressed as a binding (possibly with other
bindings as substructure) that is interpreted like a table, with the
names being the keys. If "<TT>b</TT>" is some binding and "<TT>ovs</TT>" is a
named override, then at some appropriate point, the statement:
<PRE>
res = b ++ ovs/$name;
</PRE>

is executed. Here, "<TT>b</TT>" represents a set of defaults, and
"<TT>ovs/$name</TT>" consists of a collection of overrides to the defaults
for a specific case, identified by "<TT>$name</TT>. The resulting binding
"<TT>res</TT>" is then used for the relevant building action for this
specific case.<P>

Common cases of named overrides include bindings of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedCompileOvs"><TT>NamedCompileOvs</TT></A>" that
specify how particular source files should be built, or bindings of
type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#ToolSwitches"><TT>ToolSwitches</TT></A>" that
associate abstract switch names like "debug" and "optimize" with 
particular tool-specific command-line switches.<P>

</DL>
<P>

We will see concrete examples of both kinds of overrides in the
examples that follow.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="MainVes">A Vanilla <TT>.main.ves</TT> File</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Before describing any transient overrides, we first give an example of
a vanilla "<TT>.main.ves</TT>" file that includes no overrides:
<PRE>
import self = build.ves;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/common import std_env/18;
{
    // construct the standard environment
    . = std_env()/env_build()("AlphaOSF");

    // build the package
    return ./generic/eval_binding_vals(self());
}
</PRE>

The first line of the model's body initializes the standard
environment "." specifying Alpha/OSF as the target platform. The next
line invokes the packages top-level <TT>build.ves</TT> model. This model
returns a binding of type
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#PkgResult"><TT>PkgResult</TT></A> that maps names to
0-argument closures. The function <TT>./generic/eval_binding_vals</TT>
iterates over that binding, evaluating each of the closures, and
returning a binding with the same names in the same order bound to the
result of the corresponding closure. Typically, the names are "lib",
"progs", and "tests"; the corresponding closures, when invoked, build
the package's library (if it exports one), programs, and test
programs.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="TransPkgOvsSect">Transient Package Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Perhaps the most common form of override involves overriding which
version of a package is used. Since the repository uses a two-level
namespace for naming packages, package overrides are depth-two
bindings of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#QNamedPkgOvs"><TT>QNamedPkgOvs</TT></A>" whose leaves
correspond to package models. The "Q" in the name of this type stands
for "qualified": it indicates the use of a two-level naming structure.<P>

One extremely common case when building a library package is to
override the package itself so the package's test programs will be
linked against the local version of the package. Using an override of
this form is standard procedure for library packages. Here is an
example from the "vesta/basics" package:
<PRE>
import self = build.ves;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/common import std_env/18;
{
    // construct the standard environment
    pkg_ovs = [ vesta = [ basics=self ] ]; // override with "self"
    . = std_env()/env_build()("AlphaOSF", pkg_ovs);

    // build the package
    return ./generic/eval_binding_vals(self());
}
</PRE>

The "<TT>pkg_ovs</TT>" variable binds the name of the package to the
package's top-level model. As stated before, this value is of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#QNamedPkgOvs"><TT>QNamedPkgOvs</TT></A>".<P>

Another common case occurs when you are building a program in one
package and want to build it against a local version of a library
defined in a different package. This is done by including a reference
to the appropriate checkout session and passing an extra argument to
the function for constructing the standard environment. Here is an
example from the "vesta/log" package that overrides the "vesta/basics"
package:
<PRE>
import self = build.ves;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/common import std_env/18;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta import basics/checkout/20/15;
{
    // construct the standard environment
    pkg_ovs = [ vesta = [ log=self, basics ] ]; // package overrides
    . = std_env()/env_build()("AlphaOSF", pkg_ovs);

    // build the package
    return ./generic/eval_binding_vals(self());
}
</PRE>

Any number of different packages may be overridden, including bridge
packages and the "<TT>common/bridge_generics</TT>" package. For example,
to use a checked-out version of the "<TT>common/cxx</TT>" bridge as well
as the "<TT>vesta/basics</TT>" package, you would write:
<PRE>
import self = build.ves;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/common import
    std_env/18;
    cxx/checkout/14/33;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/vesta import
    basics/checkout/20/15;
{
    // construct the standard environment
    pkg_ovs = [           // package overrides
      common = [ cxx ],
      vesta = [ log=self, basics ]];
    . = std_env()/env_build()("AlphaOSF", pkg_ovs);

    // build the package
    return ./generic/eval_binding_vals(self());
}
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="TransBuildWideSect">Transient Build-Wide Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The second-most common form of override is to override the switches
used in building an entire program, including how all of the program's
libraries are built.<P>

This is done by specifying a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#GeneralOverrides">general
override</A> for the environment. In particular, if you want to override
how various tools like the compiler or linker are invoked by specifying
particular command-line switches for them, you would override part of
the "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeSwitches"><TT>switches</TT></A>" binding for
the <A HREF="vtypes.5.html#Bridge">bridge</A> in question. To override
general build options (such as whether you want to use
<A HREF="vlibraries.5.html#NamingSect">hierarchical library names</A>), you
would override part of the <A HREF="vtypes.5.html#Bridge">bridge</A>'s
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeOptions"><TT>options</TT></A>" binding.<P>

Build-wide overrides are accomplished by recursively overlaying a
binding on the "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#Env"><TT>env_ovs</TT></A>" field of the
standard environment. For example, to compile all files built using
the Cxx bridge with the highest warning level, your .main.ves file
would be:
<PRE>
import build = build.ves;
from /vesta/src.dec.com/common import std_env/18;
{
    // construct the standard environment
    . = std_env()/env_build()("AlphaOSF");

    // build-wide override: compile all files with warnings
    . ++= [ env_ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/warnings = "-w0" ];

    // build the package
    return ./generic/eval_binding_vals(build());
}
</PRE>

Notice that the standard environment "." is overlayed with the extra
switch <I>after</I> the environment is constructed but <I>before</I> the
package's main model is built.<P>

Multiple overrides may be specified simply by creating the appropriate
binding structure. For example, to compile with debugging and maximal
warnings, and to link programs with optimization, you would overlay
the standard environment by writing:
<PRE>
    // build-wide overrides
    . ++= [ env_ovs/Cxx/switches = [
      compile = [ debug = "-g", warnings= "-w0" ],
      program = [ optimize = "-O1" ]
    ]];
</PRE>

In this binding, the names "<TT>compile</TT>" and "<TT>program</TT>" are
special, since they are hard-wired into the bridge's
so-called <A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeExpert">expert</A> functions. The
names for the individual switches are not special, except that
switches are overridden by these names. Hence, if you want to override
the default switches installed by the bridge, you will have to know
the name given by the bridge to each switch category. You can find out
the default switch names and their values by printing the value of
"<TT>./&lt;bridge&gt;/switches</TT>" after the call that creates the standard
environment.<P>

You can also use build-wide overrides to set build options. As another
example, you could specify the following overrides to enable
hierarchical library naming and to disable the bridge's verbose mode,
respectively.
<PRE>
    // use hierarchical library naming
    . ++= [ env_ovs/Cxx/options/flat_lib_names = FALSE ];

    // make the bridge quiet
    . ++= [ env_ovs/Cxx/options/verbose_bridge = FALSE ];
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="TransLibSect">Transient Library Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This section describes how to override the construction of a leaf
library or an entire umbrella library. For more information about leaf
and umbrella libraries, see the
<A HREF="vlibraries.5.html">vlibraries(5)</A> man page.<P>

The construction of a leaf or umbrella library is overridden by
augmenting the "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html"><TT>lib_ovs</TT></A>" field of the
standard environment. The value of this field is of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedLibOvs"><TT>NamedLibOvs</TT></A>". As described
with the documentation of that type, it is either a flat binding of
type "<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#NamedLibDescs"><TT>NamedLibDescs</TT></A>" or a binding tree
whose leaves are of that type. Whether the value is flat or not
depends on whether <A HREF="vlibraries.5.html#NamingSect">flat library
names</A> are being used or not.<P>

First, consider the case where flat library names are being used. Then
the "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#Env"><TT>lib_ovs</TT></A>" field of the environment
must be overridden by a value of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedLibDescs"><TT>NamedLibDescs</TT></A>". This type is
a binding mapping library names to one of the subtypes of a
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LibDesc"><TT>LibDesc</TT></A>" value, most likely a
value of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LeafLibDesc"><TT>LeafLibDesc</TT></A>" or
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#UmbrellaLibDesc"><TT>UmbrellaLibDesc</TT></A>". The
important thing about both of these types is that that have a field
name "<TT>ovs</TT>" of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeOvs"><TT>BridgeOvs</TT></A>".<P>

To determine the name of the leaf or umbrella library you want to
override, you have to look at the model that constructs that library.
The first argument to the "leaf" or "umbrella" bridge function will be
the library name.<P>

For example, to compile the "libVestaBasics.a" leaf library with debugging
symbols, you would add the following overlay to your ".main.ves" file:
<PRE>
    // library overrides
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasics.a =
      [ ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/debug = "-g" ]];
</PRE>

To build an entire umbrella library in a particular way, just name the
umbrella library instead:
<PRE>
    // library overrides
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasicsUmb =
      [ ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/debug = "-g" ]];
</PRE>

This causes all leaf libraries that are descendants of the named
umbrella library to be built with the specified override.<P>

It is also possible to override both an umbrella and a leaf with a
single override. For example, to build the entire umbrella with
debugging, but the leaf library with simple optimization, the override
would be:
<PRE>
    // library overrides
    . ++= [ lib_ovs = [
      libVestaBasicsUmb/ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/debug = "-g",
      libVestaBasics.a/ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ]];
</PRE>

So much for overriding libraries when flat library naming is being
used.<P>

If hierarchical library names are being used, then the value of the
"<TT>lib_ovs</TT>" field should be a binding. For example, if the
"libVestaBasics.a" leaf library resides in the "libVestaBasicsUmb"
umbrella, an override for the leaf library might take the form:
<PRE>
    // library overrides
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasicsUmb/libVestaBasics.a =
      [ ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/debug = "-g" ]];
</PRE>

As before, we can specify overrides for both umbrellas and leaves in a
single override. The override in the hierarchical case corresponding
to the last example presented above for the flat case is:
<PRE>
    // library overrides
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasicsUmb = [
      ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/debug = "-g",
      libVestaBasics.a/ovs/Cxx/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ]];
</PRE>

The only difference between the flat case and the hierarchical case is
that the overrides for "libVestaBasics.a" are underneath
"libVestaBasicsUmb" in the hierarchical case; in the flat case, they
are at the same level.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="TransLibFileSect">Transient Library File Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

It is also possible to override how a <I>single file</I> in a particular
leaf library is compiled. This is accomplished using a
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#NamedOverride">named override</A>.<P>

In particular, the
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LeafLibDesc"><TT>per_file_ovs</TT></A>" field of the
leaf library in question must be overridden to contain a binding of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedCompileOvs"><TT>NamedCompileOvs</TT></A>", a
binding that maps filenames to values of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#CompileOvs"><TT>CompileOvs</TT></A>". Each of these has
at most the following two fields:<P>

<DL>
<DT><TT>lang: text</TT><DD>
This field specifies the name of the bridge to use to build the program.<P>

<DT><TT>ovs: <A HREF="vtypes.5.html#BridgeOvs">BridgeOvs</A></TT><DD>
This field specifies an overlay for the bridge used to build the
program. Notice that as opposed to the "<TT>ovs</TT>" field of a
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#LeafLibDesc">leaf</A> or
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#UmbrellaLibDesc">umbrella</A> library description,
which is of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>", this is
an override for a particular bridge, not the whole environment. This
means the bridge name (such as "<TT>Cxx</TT>") should not appear in the
override.
</DL>
<P>

For example, here is a per-file override that specifies that the file
named "<TT>Basics.C</TT>" in the "<TT>libVestaBasics.a</TT>" library should be
compiled with optimization:
<PRE>
    // per-file library override
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasics.a/per_file_ovs = [
      Basics.C = [ ovs/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ]]];
</PRE>

If you were using hierarchical library naming, you would instead
write:
<PRE>
    // per-file library override
    . ++= [ lib_ovs/libVestaBasicsUmb/libVestaBasics.a/per_file_ovs = [
      Basics.C = [ ovs/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ]]];
</PRE>

Of course, in either case, the "<TT>per_file_ovs</TT>" binding is allowed
to contain names of multiple files, with each being bound to a
potentially different set of overrides instructions.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="PermLibSect">Permanent Library Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Permanent overrides work similarly to transient overrides. One main
difference is that they are usually expressed by supplying override
arguments to bridge functions, rather than by overlaying a binding
over the current environment.<P>

To override how a library is constructed, you pass an overrides
binding as an explicit argument to the "<TT>umbrella</TT>" or "<TT>leaf</TT>"
<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#Bridge">bridge</A> function. For example, assuming
the identifiers "<TT>c_files</TT>", "<TT>h_files</TT>", and
"<TT>priv_h_files</TT>" have been bound to the appropriate file bindings
in the <TT>files</TT> clause, here is a function that produces a leaf
library all of whose files will be compiled with the compiler switch
"<TT>-DDEBUG"</TT>":
<PRE>
    lib() {
	ovs = [ Cxx/switches/compile/def_debug = "-DDEBUG" ];
	return ./Cxx/leaf("libLeaf.a",
          c_files, h_files, priv_h_files, ovs);
    };
</PRE>

The value "<TT>ovs</TT>" is a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#GeneralOverride">general override</A>.
It should be of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>", i.e.,
it is a binding that is recursively overlayed on the environment in
which the library is built.<P>

You can also specify a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#NamedOverride">named override</A> for a
leaf library by passing a binding for the "<TT>per_file_ovs</TT>"
parameter of the "<TT>leaf</TT>" function. This parameter is of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedCompileOvs"><TT>NamedCompileOvs</TT></A>"; it maps
files names to values of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#CompileOvs"><TT>CompileOvs</TT></A>". For example, here
is how to build the above leaf library with the file "<TT>runtime.C</TT>"
compiled with optimization:
<PRE>
    lib() {
	ovs = [ Cxx/switches/compile/def_debug = "-DDEBUG" ];
        per_file_ovs = [ runtime.C =
          [ ovs/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ]];
	return ./Cxx/leaf("libLeaf.a",
          c_files, h_files, priv_h_files, ovs, per_file_ovs);
    };
</PRE>

Overrides for umbrella libraries work similarly. Umbrella overrides
are specified by passing a non-empty value for the "<TT>ovs</TT>" field of
the "<TT>umbrella</TT>" function. As before, this parameter is a
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#GeneralOverride">general override</A> of type
"<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>". That is, it is a binding
that is recursively overlayed on the environment in which the umbrella
library and all of its descendant libraries is built.<P>

For example, to specify that an entire umbrella library should be
built with optimization, you could write:
<PRE>
{
    // select libraries
    libs = [ ./Cxx/libs/vesta/pkg1, ./Cxx/libs/vesta/pkg2 ];

    // compile umbrella with optimization
    ovs = [ Cxx/switches/compile/optimize = "-O1" ];

    // build the umbrella
    return ./Cxx/umbrella("libExampleUmb", libs, ovs);
}
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="PermProgSect">Permanent Program Overrides</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There are three distinct parts to building a program, and permanent
overrides can be specified for each. First, the libraries on which the
program depends must be compiled. Then, the sources comprising the
program itself must be compiled. Finally, the compiled sources must be
linked with the libraries.<P>

To build a program, you use the "<TT>program</TT>" bridge function. In
addition to the sources and libraries from which the program should be
built, this function takes three additional arguments for specifying
overrides; they are named "<TT>ovs</TT>", "<TT>env_ovs</TT>", and
"<TT>lib_ovs</TT>".<P>

The "<TT>ovs</TT>" parameter is a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#GeneralOverride">general
override</A> of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>" applied
to the environment in which the program's sources are compiled and in
which the final program is linked.<P>

The "<TT>env_ovs</TT>" parameter is also a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#GeneralOverride">general
override</A> of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#EnvOvs"><TT>EnvOvs</TT></A>". It is
applied to the environment in which the program's libraries are built.<P>

Finally, the "<TT>lib_ovs</TT>" is a <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#NamedOverride">named override</A>
of type "<A HREF="vtypes.5.html#NamedLibOvs"><TT>NamedLibOvs</TT></A>" that can
be used to specify overrides for how particular libraries or files
within those libraries are built.<P>

Notice that the general overrides "<TT>ovs</TT>" and "<TT>env_ovs</TT>" apply
to independent parts of the build process. If you want the same
override to apply to both parts, you have to specify that same
override in both parameters. (Another alternative is to specify the
override in "<TT>./env_ovs</TT>" as described below.)<P>

Here is a simple example, taken from the "vesta/basics" package. This
model builds several test programs; it demonstrates the use of the
"<TT>ovs</TT>" and "<TT>env_ovs</TT>" parameters.
<PRE>
files
    TestIntSeq = [ TestIntSeq.C ];
    TestIntTbl = [ TestIntTbl.C ];
    TestOS     = [ TestOS.C ];
    TestText   = [ TestText.C ];
    TestThread = [ TestThread.C ];
    TestVAF    = [ TestVestaAtomicFile.C ];
{
    libs = &lt; ./Cxx/libs/vesta/basics &gt;;
    ovs = [ Cxx/switches/program/shared_libs = "-non_shared" ];
    env_ovs = [ Cxx/options/useGClib = "libgcthrd" ];
    return
      ./Cxx/program("TestText",   TestText,   [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestTextGC", TestText,   [], libs, ovs, env_ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestIntSeq", TestIntSeq, [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestIntTbl", TestIntTbl, [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestOS",     TestOS,     [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestThread", TestThread, [], libs, ovs) +
      ./Cxx/program("TestVAF",    TestVAF,    [], libs, ovs);

The "<TT>env_ovs</TT>" override specifies that the program should be built
to use the garbage collector library. That override is only supplied
when the "TextTextGC" program is built, so all the other programs are
linked without the garbage collector.<P>

All three of the "<TT>program</TT>" overrides can also be specified
indirectly through overrides to the current environment. In
particular, the general overrides in "<TT>./env_ovs</TT>" are applied
<I>both</I> to the construction of the program's libraries, and to the
construction and linking of the program itself. The named overrides in
"<TT>./lib_ovs</TT>" are applied during the construction of the libraries,
as if they had been passed via the explicit "<TT>lib_ovs</TT>" parameter.
For more information about these two types of overrides, see the above
sections on <A HREF="voverrides.5.html#TransBuildWideSect">build-wide overrides</A>,
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#TransLibSect">library overrides</A>, and
<A HREF="voverrides.5.html#TransLibFileSect">library file overrides</A>. By placing such
files in regular models instead of the special "<TT>.main.ves</TT>" model,
they become permanent instead of transient. In cases where both an
override through "<TT>.</TT>" and one through an explicit parameter are
specified, the former takes precedence.<P>

Passing explicit values is convenient if you are building several
programs with different overrides, as the example above demonstrates.
When all of the programs are being built with the same overrides, it
may be more convenient to specify them via an override to the standard
environment. As a final example, here is a model from the "vesta/fp"
package that uses a combination of the two styles:
<PRE>
files TestFP = [ TestFP.C ];
import lib = build.ves;
{
    // required libraries
    v_libs = ./Cxx/libs/vesta;
    libs = &lt; v_libs/fp, v_libs/srpc, v_libs/log, v_libs/basics &gt;;

    // overrides for this program
    ovs = [ Cxx/switches/program/shared_libs = "-non_shared" ];
    . ++= [ env_ovs/Cxx/options/useGClib = "libgcthrd" ];

    // build program
    return ./Cxx/program("TestFP", TestFP, [], libs, ovs);
}
</PRE>

The "<TT>ovs</TT>" parameter specifies that the program should be
statically linked, and the override to "<TT>./env_ovs</TT>" specifies that
the program should be built with the GC version of the libraries.<P>
