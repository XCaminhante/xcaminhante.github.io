    <h1>Re-exporting the repository with Samba</h1>

    <p>

      At this time, Vesta doesn't directly support Windows clients.
      However, it's easy to give them access to the repository by
      re-exporting it using <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.

    </p>

    <p>

      All you need is a Vesta client machine with Samba installed.
      Simply add this to the end of your <tt>smb.conf</tt>
      configuration file (probably <tt>/etc/smb.conf</tt> or
      <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>):

    </p>

    <pre>[vesta]
   comment = Vesta Repository
   browsable = yes
   writable = no
   path = /vesta

[vestawork]
   comment = vesta-work Directory
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   path = /vesta-work/%u</pre>

    <p>

      After adding this (and restarting the Samba daemon to make the
      changes take effect), you can access
      <tt>\\<i>sambaserver</i>\vesta</tt> and
      <tt>\\<i>sambaserver</i>\vestawork</tt> from a Windows machine.
      You can map them to drive letters <tt>V:</tt> and <tt>W:</tt> to
      make them easier to access.

    </p>

    <p>

      Of course this won't allow any of the client programs to work on
      Windows.  You'll still need a shell on a supported platform to
      create packages, check out, check in, etc.  However, this will
      allow you to use native Windows editors and filesystem
      utilities.

      You can read all files in the appendable part of the repository
      and make changes to your checkout working directories.  The user
      you log in as will determine which subdirectory of
      <tt>/vesta-work</tt> appears in
      <tt>\\<i>sambaserver</i>\vestawork</tt>.  Changes that you make
      with Vesta command-line tools (e.g. creating packages,
      checkouts, etc.) will show up in the drives exported by Samba.

    </p>
