    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>
      In some situations, it's not possible to initiate a direct TCP
      connection to the source repository you want to replicate
      from.&nbsp; Your destination repository could be behind a
      firewall with strict rules about outgoing connections, or the
      source repository could be behind a firewall with strict rules
      about incoming connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Replication only requires connections to a single TCP
      port.&nbsp; (Specifically the one in the

      <a href="../../man/html/vesta.cfg.5.html">config file</a>
      setting <tt>[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port</tt>, usually
      21776.)&nbsp; Because of this, it's possible to securely tunnel
      a replication with the <i>port forwarding</i> feature provided
      by

      <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> and other SSH
      implementations.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Hosts">Hosts</a></h2>

    <p>
      Replication over SSH port-forwarding involves at least two
      different hosts (an SSH client and an SSH server), but possibly
      as many as five:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	The host where
	<a href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">the replicator</a> is
	run
      </li>
      <li>
	The destination repository
      </li>
      <li>
	A host which the destination repository can connect to (which
	can be either the SSH client or the SSH server)
      </li>
      <li>
	A host which can connect to the source repository (the other
	end of the SSH connection)
      </li>
      <li>
	The source repository
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In the simplest case, 1-3 are all the same host and 4 and 5 are
      the same host, but they could all be different.
    </p>

    <p>
      Port forwarding can go in either direction (from the SSH client
      to the SSH server, or from the server to the client).&nbsp;
      Because of this flexibility, host 3 can act as an SSH client to
      host 4, or host 4 can act as an SSH client to host 3.&nbsp;
      However, the port-forward must always go from the destination
      side to the source side (from host 3 to host 4).
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Access Control">Access Control</a></h2>
    
    <p>
      One important prerequisite is ensuring that the source
      repository will allow read access over the port-forwarded
      connection.&nbsp; This usually requires using one of the
      following methods:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Adjusting the

	<a href="../../man/html/repository.8.html#Export%20file">repository export file</a>.&nbsp;

	Specifically, the source repository must allow read access
	with the realm used at the destination from the host on the
	source end of the SSH connection (host #4 above).&nbsp; (If
	you don't know what your realm is, you can find out with the
	command

	&quot;<tt><a href="../../man/html/vgetconfig.1.html">vgetconfig</a>

	  <a href="../../man/html/repository.8.html#Configuration">Repository</a>
	  realm</tt>&quot;.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Explicitly specifying the global user name to be used when
	talking to the source repository during replication on the
	replicator command line with

	<a href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html#-s">the &quot;<tt>-s</tt>&quot; option</a>.&nbsp;

	This allows one to bypass the need to change the export file
	at the source repository, but requires knowing a global user
	name which will be allowed access from the source end of the
	SSH connection.&nbsp; (If you don't know what a global name
	is, refer to

	<a href="../../man/html/repository.8.html#Principal%20identification%20and%20authentication">the section on pricipal identification
	in the repository(8) man page</a>.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to having access to the source repository over the
      SSH port forward, the destination repository will also have to
      be told to allow replication from the destination end of the SSH
      connection.&nbsp; This requires adding an appropriate
      &quot;<tt>#replicate-from</tt>&quot; attribute in the
      destination repository.&nbsp; (See

      <a href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">the vrepl(1) man page</a>

      for a description of this attribute.)
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Example #1">Example #1</a></h2>

    <p>
      A user with Vesta installed behind a corporate firewall that
      wishes to replicate from <tt>pub.vestasys.org</tt>, but can't
      because of outgoing restrictions on the firewall.&nbsp; However,
      the corporate firewall <em>does</em> allow outgoing SSH
      connections, and they want to use this to tunnel out to the
      public repository.&nbsp; They have a Linux machine at home on a
      broadband connection which is running an SSH server.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example the hosts will be:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<b><tt>workstation.example.com</tt></b>: The user will run

	<a href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">the replicator</a> on
	their workstation, which is behind the corporate firewall and
	is a client of the destination repository
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>vesta.example.com</tt></b>: The destination repository,
	also behind the corporate firewall
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>workstation.example.com</tt></b>: The user will also
	run the SSH client on their workstation
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net</tt></b>: The user's Linux
	machine at home on a broadband connection, which will be used
	as an SSH server.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>pub.vestasys.org</tt></b>: The source repository
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The user first arranges to allow replications using their
      workstation as the source repository:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com% <b>su vadmin</b>
Password:
vadmin@workstation.example.com% <b>vattrib -a "#replicate-from" workstation.example.com:21776 /vesta</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Of course their workstation isn't really the source repository,
      but it will look like it is to the replication and the
      destination repository, since that's where the incoming end of
      the port-forward will be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next the user starts the SSH client, connecting out to their
      home Linux machine with a port forward through to
      <tt>pub.vestasys.org</tt>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com% <b>ssh -L 21776:pub.vestasys.org:21776 -g jsmith@user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Leaving the ssh client running, they start the replication on
      their workstation:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com%  <b>vrepl -s workstation.example.com:21776 -e@ /vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/release/LAST/linux_i386.main.ves</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      It's worth noting that this requires no changes to the access
      control configuration on the source repository, because
      <tt>pub.vestasys.org</tt> allows anyone to have read-only
      access.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="Example #2">Example #2</a></h2>

    <p>
      A user with Vesta installed both at work behind a corporate
      firewall and at home behind a personal firewall wishes to
      replicate from their repository at home to their repository at
      work.&nbsp; Both machines are behind firewalls that would
      prevent this.&nbsp; However, the corporate firewall allows
      incoming SSH connections, which the user will use to tunnel
      between the two repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example the hosts will be:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<b><tt>workstation.example.com</tt></b>: The user will run

	<a href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">the replicator</a> on
	their workstation, which is behind the corporate firewall and
	is a client of the destination repository
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>vesta.example.com</tt></b>: The destination repository,
	also behind the corporate firewall
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net</tt></b>: The user will run
	the SSH client on their home Linux machine to connect into the
	corporate network
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>ssh.example.com</tt></b>: The corporate SSH server.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b><tt>user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net</tt></b>: The source
	repository is also running on the user's home Linux machine
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      First, the user adds a line to the source repository's export
      file to allow the realm of the destination repository access:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net% <b>su vadmin</b>
Password:
vadmin@user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net% <b>echo "127.0.0.1: ro example.com" >> /etc/vesta/repos.export</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      (Note that unless you've used the RPM or Dedian packages to
      install Vesta, this may not be where your export file is.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Next the user starts the SSH client, connecting into the company
      network with a port forward pointing back to the repository
      running on their home computer:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@user1234.dsl.exampleisp.net% <b>ssh -R 21776:localhost:21776 -g jsmith@ssh.example.com</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Now that they've logged into the company network, the user
      arranges to allow replications using the company SSH server
      (which is be the destination end of the port forward) as the
      source repository:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com% <b>su vadmin</b>
Password:
vadmin@workstation.example.com% <b>vattrib -a "#replicate-from" ssh.example.com:21776 /vesta</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Before trying a replication, just to make sure everything's
      working, the user runs a simple client to test the port
      forwarded connection to their home repository:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com%  <b>vid -R ssh.example.com</b>
User names and aliases:
  jsmith@example.com
Groups:
Unix (NFS) user ID:          203
Unix (NFS) primary group ID: 202
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Satisfied that everything's working, they start the replication
      on their workstation:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>jsmith@workstation.example.com%  <b>vrepl -s ssh.example.com:21776 -e+ /vesta/jsmith_exampleisp.net/*/LAST</b></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h2><a name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

    <p>
      While replication only requires a uni-directional connection to
      the source repository, mastership transfer requires
      bi-directional connections.&nbsp; That means that SSH
      port-forwarding alone is <b>not</b> sufficient for checking out
      an object mastered at a remote repository.&nbsp; For that, you
      need a more significant VPN solution.
    </p>

	  Port forwarding can go either from the SSH client to the SSH
	  server, or from the server to the client.&nbsp; Make sure
	  you have it going in the right direction (from the
	  destination side to the source side).
	</p>

	<p>
	  Other possible causes include:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>The source repository isn't running</li>

	  <li>The wrong host was specified for the source end of the
	  port forward</li>

	  <li>Something is preventing the source end of the SSH

	  You can check whether you've gotten it right by running
