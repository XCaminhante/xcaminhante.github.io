    <h1>Upgrading Vesta by Shipping a New Release</h1>

<p>
When a new release of Vesta becomes available, using <a
href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">the
replicator</a> to copy the sources over the Internet is almost always
faster than downloading a binary kit.  Because of Vesta's guarantee of
precise build repeatability, once you have the sources replicated you
can build the new Vesta release locally and upgrade your installation
by having <a
href="../../man/html/vesta.1.html">the
evaluator</a> <a
href="../../man/html/vesta.1.html#shipping-options">ship</a>
it into place.  This document describes how to do this.
</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>
First of all, just in case it wasn't obvious, you must already have a
working installation of Vesta to do this.  (If you don't already have
Vesta installed, see <a href="../../getting-started.html">Getting
Started with Vesta</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The administrator user (normally named <tt>vadmin</tt>) must be the
owner of the installation root (normally <tt>/vesta-srv</tt>) as well
as the <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>man</tt> subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
Because the upgrade is performed as <tt>vadmin</tt>, some care must be
taken to keep the setuid root <tt>tool_launcher</tt> program working.
Specifically, you should to the following as <tt>vadmin</tt>:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<tt>cd <i>/vesta-srv</i>/bin</tt>
</li>

<li>
<tt>mv tool_launcher tool_launcher.suid</tt>
</li>

<li>
<tt>ln -s tool_launcher.suid tool_launcher</tt>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
You need to make sure that <tt>[Evaluator]DefaultMain</tt> is set such
that the correct top-level model for your platform will be picked from
the release.  (For example, if you use Vesta on i686 Linux, then you
could set <tt>[Evaluator]DefaultMain</tt> to
&quot;<tt>linux_i686.main.ves</tt>&quot;.)
</p>

<p>
Lastly, you'll need a small shell script named <a
href="vshiprel"><tt>vshiprel</tt></a> which is used for doing upgrade.
(It's name is linked to the script, so you can just save it to disk
from your web browser.)  Note that you will need to adjust the
definition of <tt>iroot</tt> if you have Vesta installed at a path
other than <tt>/vesta-srv</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Doing an Upgrade</h2>

<p>
First you need to replicate the new release to your repository.  To do
this you must know which release number you want to upgrade to, and
which top-level model your platform uses.  If you're upgrading to
<tt>release/12</tt> and you use Vesta on i686 Linux, then you would run
the replicator like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<tt><a
href="../../man/html/vrepl.1.html">vrepl</a> -I -s pub.vestasys.org:21776 -e@ /vesta/vestasys.org/vesta/release/12/linux_i686.main.ves</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once the release is replicated to your repository, all you need to do
is run <a href="vshiprel"><tt>vshiprel</tt></a> as <tt>vadmin</tt>
with the release number as its single argument:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>su vadmin
<a href="vshiprel">vshiprel</a> 12</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="vshiprel"><tt>vshiprel</tt></a> will run the evaluator to
build the release and then copy it into place.  After it completes,
restart your <a
href="../../man/html/repository.8.html">repository
server</a>, <a
href="../../man/html/VCache.1.html">cache
server</a>, and <a
href="../../man/html/RunToolServer.1.html"><tt>RunToolServer</tt></a>.
</p>

<p>
If for any reason something goes wrong with the new release and you
need to revert to the previously installed binaries, all you need to
do is restore the ones preserved by <a
href="vshiprel"><tt>vshiprel</tt></a> in the <tt>bin-old</tt>
directory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>su vadmin
cd /vesta-srv
rm -rf bin
mv bin-old bin</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once you decide that the new release is working and you won't need to
revert, you can delete the <tt>bin-old</tt> directory:
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
<tt>vshiprel</tt> does not handle multi-platform installations.
Extending it to do so is left as an exercise to the reader.
