<H1>Vesta Tutorial</H1>

<P>This document walks you through an example use of the Vesta
software configuration management system. The tutorial covers the main
commands you'll need to know as a Vesta user. Each of these commands
has a detailed man page, available both in nroff and HTML format. The
<A HREF="http://www.vestasys.org/doc/man/html/">HTML man pages</A> have pictures that help to
clarify what is going on.</p>

<P>Some of these commands tell you to type long file pathnames. You
can of course make symbolic links in your home directory so that you
can type shorter names. The "pushd" command, editable history, and
tab-completion of filenames (available in some shells) are other handy
features that save typing.</p>

<DL>


<DT><B>Pick a name for your new package.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>For this example, we'll use "<tt>jones_hello</tt>", where you
should replace "<tt>jones</tt>" by your own user name.  Or you could
choose any package name that no one else at your site has used yet.
<P>

<DT><B>A note on site names and &quot;play&quot; directories</B></DT>
<DD>

<P>Throughout this tutuorial, you'll notice references to paths
starting with &quot;<tt>/vesta/play.example.com</tt>&quot;.  You should
replace &quot;<tt>example.com</tt>&quot; with your local <i>site
name</i>.  This is a name chosen for each Vesta installation which
represents your portion of the global Vesta name space, and is
traditionally based on a domain you have control over.
<P>

<p>
The use of &quot;<tt>play</tt>&quot; is to designate a spearate area
for users to experiment (such as when learning Vesta).  (Perhaps the
data for a real project named &quot;<tt>foo</tt>&quot; would be stored
in &quot;<tt>/vesta/foo.example.com</tt>&quot; or
&quot;<tt>/vesta/example.com/foo</tt>&quot;.)
Some sites instead chose to create a &quot;<tt>play</tt>&quot;
directory at a lower level of the hierarchy
(e.g. &quot;<tt>/vesta/example.com/play</tt>&quot;).  If you're unsure
where your play directory is, try typing:
</p>

<PRE>
  ls -1d /vesta/play.* /vesta/*/play
</PRE>

<p>
If for some reason you can't find one, ask your Vesta administrator.
Or, if you <em>are</em> the administrator, become the special
<em>wizard user</em> (normally named &quot;<tt>vwizard</tt>&quot;) and
type (again, substituting a domain you control for
&quot;<tt>example.com</tt>&quot;):
</p>

<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vmkdir.1.html">vmkdir</A> -p /vesta/play.example.com
</PRE>

<DT><B>Create the package.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vcreate.1.html">vcreate</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<p>
<tt>vcreate</tt> will print out the full path where it creates the
package.  (Recent versions will first prompt you for a description of
the package you are creating.)  You should substitue this for
&quot;<tt>/vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello</tt>&quot; throughout
this tutorial.</p>

<p>To see what you've done, you can type:</p>
<PRE>
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>
The <TT>ls</TT> output won't be too interesting: the package has no versions,
just an empty directory called "checkout" and a symbolic link called
"latest" with nothing to point to.  The
<A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html"><I>vattrib</I></A> output
shows you some information about the package.
</DD>
<P>

<DT><B>Another way to save typing.</B></DT>
<DD>

<p>
Aside from the methods mentioned above, you can save yourself a little
typing by setting the configuration variable
<tt>[UserInterface]DefaultPackageParent</tt> (in your site's
<a href="man/html/vesta.cfg.5.html"><tt>vesta.cfg</tt></a> file) to
&quot;<tt>/vesta/play.example.com</tt>&quot;.  The repository tools
will interpret unqualified paths relative to this, so you could then
just type &quot;<tt><A HREF="man/html/vcreate.1.html">vcreate</A>
jones_hello</tt>&quot;.  If you haven't set it, the default is
&quot;<tt>.</tt>&quot;, which means you either need to give the full
path on the command line (as above) or change your working directory
to where you want to perform an operation:</p>

<PRE>
  cd /vesta/play.example.com
  <A HREF="man/html/vcreate.1.html">vcreate</A> ./jones_hello
</PRE>

<DT><B>Check out the package to begin creating version 1.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckout.1.html">vcheckout</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<p>Recent versions will prompt you for a description of the change
you're planning on making.  To see what you've done, you can type:</p>

<PRE>
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/1
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/checkout/1

  ls -lR /vesta-work/jones
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello
</PRE>

<P>This step creates several things: a <I>working directory</I>, a <I>session
directory</I>, and a <I>reservation stub</I>.

<P>The <I>working directory</I> is
<tt>/vesta-work/jones/jones_hello</tt>.  This is a directory in which
you can create and edit files that will go into the package.  If you
had checked out a package that had existing versions, the directory
would have started out with a copy of the last version in it; as it
is, the directory starts out empty.

<P>The <I>session directory</I> is a directory for intermediate versions of
the package that you make while you are working on it but before you
are ready to check it in as version 1.  We'll say more about this below.

<P>The <I>reservation stub</I> is
<tt>/vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/1</tt>.  This is a placeholder with
the same name that version 1 of the package will have when you check
it in.  It reserves or "locks" the version number so that two people
can't inadvertently work on creating the same new version at the same
time.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Edit the working directory.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type anything that creates one or more
files in the working directory; for instance:
<PRE>
  cd /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello
  echo "Hello world" &gt; hello
</PRE>
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Snapshot the working directory.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vadvance.1.html">vadvance</A>
</PRE>

<P>To see what you've done, you can type:
<PRE>
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/checkout/1
  diff -r /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/checkout/1/1 .
</PRE>

<P>Notice that
<tt>/vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/checkout/1/1</tt> is now an
exact snapshot of <tt>/vesta-work/jones/jones_hello</tt>, except that
none of the files in the former have write permission.  You can make
snapshots like this at any time while you have the package checked
out.  The snapshots are immutable: even if you are <tt>vadmin</tt> or
the superuser, you can't modify the files and directories in them.

<P>Now try typing "<tt>vadvance</tt>" again without changing anything
in the working directory.  It's smart enough to notice that no new
snapshot is required.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Repeat the previous two steps a few times if you like.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Each time you edit a file in the package and then run vadvance, a
new snapshot version is created within the session directory. The
directories for the sub-versions are named
<tt>jones_hello/checkout/1/1</tt>, <tt>jones_hello/checkout/1/2</tt>,
<tt>jones_hello/checkout/1/3</tt>, etc.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Check in the package.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckin.1.html">vcheckin</A>
</PRE>

<p>You will be prompted to describe the change you've made. To see
what you've done, you can type:</p>

<PRE>
  cd
  ls -lR /vesta-work/jones
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<P>What happened?  Your working directory was deleted, and the final
snapshot from your session directory replaced the stub that was
created by <tt>vcheckout</tt>.  Version 1 of your package is now checked in.
The checked-in version is immutable, just like the snapshot versions
in your session directory.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Check out the package again.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckout.1.html">vcheckout</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<P>To see what you've done, you can type:
<PRE>
  ls -l /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<P>Your working directory is back, with its contents initialized to
version 1, and you have a session directory and stub for version 2.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Copy in a real program and some Vesta models for building it.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<PRE>
  cd /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello
  cp -r /vesta/vestasys.org/examples/hello_c/latest/* .
  chmod -R u+w .
  <A HREF="man/html/vupdate.1.html">vupdate</A> linux_i386.main.ves
</PRE>

<p>
(If you're not using Vesta on Linux i386, substitute the top-level
model name for your platform for <tt>linux_i386.main.ves</tt>.  Some
of the other standard names used for top-level models include
<tt>linux_alpha.main.ves</tt>, <tt>linux_ppc.main.ves</tt>, and
<tt>tru64_alpha.main.ves</tt>.)
</p>

<P>You can look over the files that are copied in if you like, but we
won't explain the model files (<tt>linux_i386.main.ves</tt> and
<tt>build.ves</tt>) at this point.

<P>The <tt>vupdate</tt> command shown at the end updates the model
files to be sure they import the latest version of the standard
development environment at your site.  (That is, the compilers,
libraries, etc.)  It's often a good idea to do this right after you
check out a package or copy in some source files that may not have
been worked on for a while and may import an older version.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Build the program.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</A>
</PRE>

<P>If this is the very first time anyone has built anything since you
installed Vesta, it may take some time as all the libraries that the
program is linked against are built.  After that, the Vesta cache will
be populated, and only <tt>hello.c</tt> will be compiled.

<P>The <tt>vmake</tt> command is really just a convenient shell script
that deletes any junk files (like core files and emacs backup files),
runs <tt>vadvance</tt>, and then invokes the Vesta builder (called
simply &quot;<tt>vesta</tt>&quot;) on the resulting snapshot.  The
vadvance is needed because the Vesta builder can build <I>only</I>
from immutable sources -- checked in versions or snapshot versions in
session directories.

<P>Now try typing &quot;<tt>vmake</tt>&quot; again. <tt>vadvance</tt>
will notice that nothing has changed, so no new snapshot will be
needed.  Then the Vesta builder, trying to redo a build it has just
done, will get a top-level cache hit and finish almost instantly.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Ship the program.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</A> -shipto /tmp
</PRE>

<P>You could have typed this right away in the previous step, but we
wanted to explain building and shipping separately.

<P>This command does the same <tt>vmake</tt> again, then copies the
final output of the build (here the program "<tt>hello</tt>") into
<tt>/tmp</tt> so that you can try it out.  Without the ship flags,
<tt>vmake</tt> (or <tt>vesta</tt>) simply writes everything you've
built into the Vesta cache; it doesn't make any of the output visible
in a directory.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Do some development.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Get <tt>hello.c</tt> into your favorite text editor and make some
changes, then repeat the build and/or ship from the last two steps.
Do this several times if you like.

<P>If you'd like to build a slightly more complicated program, you can
add more .c files to the <tt>build.ves</tt> model by adding them to
the definition of <tt>c_files</tt> at the top, separated by commas,
and if you have .h files, you can add them too.  For example:
<PRE>
files
    c_files = [ hello.c, goodbye.c ];
    h_files = [ greetings.h ];
{
    libs = &lt; ./libs/c/libc &gt;;
    return ./C/program("hello", c_files, h_files, libs);
}
</PRE>
</DD>
<P>
<a name="makebranch"><DT><B>Make a branch.</B></DT></a>
<DD>
<P>Suppose that someone else wants to work on the <tt>jones_hello</tt>
package while you have it checked out, or that you want to work on two
different sets of changes to the package at once.  Perhaps while
you're working on some major changes that you aren't ready to check in
yet, someone comes to you and asks for a quick bug fix to the latest
checked in version.  Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vbranch.1.html">vbranch</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/1.quickfix
</PRE>

<P>To see what you've done, you can type:
<PRE>
  ls -lR /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/1.quickfix
  diff -r /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/{1,1.quickfix/0}
</PRE>

<P>The <tt>vbranch</tt> command creates a branch in the tree of
versions for the <tt>jones_hello</tt> package. The main trunk versions
have names like <tt>jones_hello/1</tt>, <tt>jones_hello/2</tt>,
etc. Versions that branch off of version 1 have names like
<tt>jones_hello/1.quickfix/1</tt>, <tt>jones_hello/1.quickfix/2</tt>,
etc.

<P>The directory <tt>jones_hello/1.quickfix</tt> is really a <I>new
package</I>, but instead of starting out empty like a package made
with <tt>vcreate</tt> does, it starts out with a version 0 that is
identical to the version it branched from.  This is a simple but
powerful concept.  You can use <tt>vbranch</tt> to make any number of
branches from any version of any package, including branches from
branches.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Check out the branch.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>You check branches in and out just like normal packages.  Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckout.1.html">vcheckout</A> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/1.quickfix
</PRE>

<P>Because you already have another version of the jones_hello package
checked out, <tt>vcheckout</tt> will pick a new working directory name
for you.  If you've been following the script exactly, the new working
directory will be called <tt>/vesta-work/jones/jones_hello.1</tt>.
Here the .1 is just an arbitrary unique number, not related to version
numbers.

<P>To see what you've done, type:
<PRE>
  ls -l /vesta-work/jones
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> /vesta-work/jones/jones_hello.1
</PRE>

<P>Notice how the attributes of the two working directories show you
which is which.  You are also free to rename your working directories
to whatever you like, or to choose names explicitly in the vcheckout
command; for the latter, see
<a href="man/html/vcheckout.1.html#-w">the description of the -w
flag</a> in <A HREF="man/html/vcheckout.1.html">the vcheckout man
page</A>.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Who has what checked out?</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vwhohas.1.html">vwhohas</a> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vwhohas.1.html">vwhohas</a> -b /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

<p>You can also see all active checkouts in your entire repository
(though this can take some time if your repository is large) with:</p>

<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vwhohas.1.html">vwhohas</a>
</PRE>

<P>See the <A HREF="man/html/vwhohas.1.html">vwhohas</A> man page
for details on all the options.

</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>What's the latest?</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  <a href="http://www.vestasys.org/doc/doc/man/html/vlatest.1.html">vlatest</a> /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
  ls -l /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/latest
</PRE>

<P>These commands use different mechanisms, but both show you what
version of <tt>jones_hello</tt> is the latest.  They start to be useful
when you have many versions checked in and it becomes tedious to <TT>ls</TT>
the directory and find the highest number by eye.  The symbolic link
<TT>latest</TT> is especially handy when you want to look at the latest
version in a text editor.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vestasys.org/doc/doc/man/html/vlatest.1.html">vlatest</a> also has other
options:</p>

<PRE>
  <a href="http://www.vestasys.org/doc/doc/man/html/vlatest.1.html">vlatest</a> -b /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello
</PRE>

</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Tidy up.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Type:
<PRE>
  cd /vesta-work/jones
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckin.1.html">vcheckin</A> jones_hello
  <A HREF="man/html/vcheckin.1.html">vcheckin</A> jones_hello.1
</PRE>
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Merging branches.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>Vesta provides no special tools for merging branches.  However,
because the common base version and the latest version on each branch
are kept available as directories, you can use common Unix tools like
diff, diff3, and patch to compare versions and merge changes from one
branch into another.  The common base version of two branches is easy
to find given Vesta's version naming conventions.  Or, even if you've
overridden the default naming convention (which you can do using
special flags to the tools) you can trace back from each version to
its predecessor by looking at the <I>old-version</I> attributes with
<A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html"><I>vattrib</I></A>.

<P>If a newly checked-in version logically has two predecessors, because
you made it by merging in changes from another branch, you might want
to make its old-version attribute show both predecessors.  Attribute
values are actually <I>sets</I> of strings, so you can do this by adding
the second predecessor to the set.  For instance, if you copied
/vesta/vestasys.org/examples/hello_c/2 into the jones_hello package to
make version 2 of jones_hello, you might do this:
<PRE>
  <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html">vattrib</A> -a old-version /vesta/vestasys.org/examples/hello_c/2 \
    /vesta/play.example.com/jones_hello/2
</PRE>

<P>Future Vesta branch merging tools might do this sort of thing
automatically.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>A note on deletion and ghosts.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>In general, it's considered bad form to delete anything from the Vesta
repository (that is, the part under /vesta, not /vesta-work).  The
Vesta philosophy is that sources should be immutable and immortal, so
that all builds can be reproduced and you can always get back any old
code that may be useful later.

<P>Vesta does allow deletion under some very limited circumstances.
You can't delete anything from an immutable directory (a version or a
subdirectory of a version).  You can delete from higher level
directories, but a <I>ghost</I> is left behind.  A ghost is a null
object that prevents a version number from being reused in the future
with different contents, which could produce inconsistent builds.  A
ghost appears in "<TT>ls -l</TT>" listings with access permissions
"---------T".

<P>Usually deletion is restricted to vadmin and the superuser, though
you can change that by editing your site's
<a href="man/html/vesta.cfg.5.html"><TT>vesta.cfg</TT></a> file.

<P>It is possible to &quot;revive&quot; a ghost by copying the deleted
data back into place from another replica; see the <I>vrepl</I> man
page referenced in the next section.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>A note on replication.</B></DT>
<DD>

<p>
Part of the suggested Vesta installation procedure is to replicate a
copy of the latest Vesta source code from the public repository.
Roughly, that means that the two repositories are the same except for
things that are present in one but missing in the other.  If the same
name is defined in both, it means the same thing in both.
</p>

<P>There is a flag on every object in a repository saying whether or
not that repository's copy of the object is the master copy.

When you have a nonmaster copy of a directory, you are not permitted
to insert anything into it except by copying it from another
repository.

There is a special exception for <TT>/vesta</TT> itself; you are
allowed to create a subdirectory of <TT>/vesta</TT> using an Internet
domain name that belongs to you.  Your repository then becomes master
for that subdirectory and (by default) everything below it.  The Vesta
free software project's repository is master for
<TT>/vesta/vestasys.org</TT>, so in your repository, the master flags
are off for all directories in that tree.  You can see an object's
master flag using <A HREF="man/html/vattrib.1.html"><I>vattrib</I></A>.

<P>The <A HREF="man/html/vrepl.1.html"><I>vrepl</I></A> tool is
used to copy sources from one repository to another.  You can set up
semi-automatic replication by running vrepl periodically, using (for
example) the Unix cron(8) facility.

</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>A note on weeding.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>As you build new things with Vesta, your cache will grow until it
begins to fill up the disk partition you've assigned to it.  At that
point you'll need to run the <I>weeder</I> to delete some things from the
cache.  See the <A HREF="man/html/VestaWeed.1.html">VestaWeed</A>
man page.
</DD>
<P>
<DT><B>Where to go next.</B></DT>
<DD>
<P>This tutorial should have given you a pretty complete feel for how to
use Vesta's source control features.  All the commands shown above
have many optional flags that modify their behavior, but you will
rarely need to give any flags at all.

<P>We've said very little in this tutorial about writing models.  You
can write models for many simple programs by following the patterns in
<TT>example/hello_c</TT> and <TT>example/hello_cxx</TT>, extending
them to more .c and .h files as shown above.  To learn more about
writing models, see <a href="sdl-ref/index.html">the SDL programmer's
guide</a>.

<P>A good starting point for further reading is the <A
HREF="../index.html">Vesta home page</A>.
