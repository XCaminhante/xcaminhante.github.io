<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
We'll go through some basics of creating models in Vesta with some examples.&nbsp;
We'll start out slowly, but pick up the pace midway through.&nbsp;
By the end, we will have built a program under Vesta and executed it under
Vesta control (just like the way compilers and other tools get executed).
<p>For starters, you'll need a package somewhere to perform these examples
in. Any old package will do, but you'll probably want to create a new one
(since we'll be creating files with names like <tt>.main.ves</tt>). Plus,
of course, you'll need to check it out to follow through these examples,
since we'll be doing things like creating files in the package and using
<tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a></tt>.
(We assume that you are already familiar enough with Vesta to handle this.
If not, you should go through <a href="../tutorial.html">the
Vesta tutorial</a> first.)
<p>You might find that you get cache hits on some of these examples, depending
on how precisely you enter the text.&nbsp; (I evaluated these models while
developing this tutorial, and others probably will when they go through
it.)&nbsp; You can try altering the models slightly (changing variable
names, or stings like "Hello World" to "Greetings Planet") or just using
<tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
-cache none</tt> instead of <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a></tt>
alone.
<h3>
<a NAME="HelloWorld"></a>Hello World, Vesta Style</h3>
This is downright simple. Create a file in your package named
<tt>hello.ves</tt>,
and fill it with this text:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> "Hello World!";
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now type <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
-result hello.ves</tt> at your shell from within the working directory for your
package, and look at what you get back from the evaluator. It should look
something like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998

Return value of `hello.ves':
&nbsp; <b>"Hello World!"

</b>No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `hello.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>See the "Hello World!" in the middle? (We made it bold so it would be
easier to spot.)
<p>You've just written a very simple program in the Vesta system modeling
language. It's a function which returns a string constant.
<p>Before we move on, let's make a small change to <tt>hello.ves</tt>:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>("Hello World!");
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you do <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
hello.ves</tt> again, you'll get this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998
<b>"Hello World!"

</b>Return value of `hello.ves':
&nbsp; "Hello World!"

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `hello.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>See the first "Hello World!" which showed up that time? That's from
the call to the <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
function. There are three important points to note about this before moving
on:
<ol>
<li>
Even though we printed out "Hello World!" (which was the point), we didn't
remove the <tt><a href="statements.html#return">return</a></tt> statement.
In fact, we can't. The Vesta system modeling language language is a <a href="functional.html">functional
programming language</a>. Every system model is a function and
<b>must</b>
return a value. The last statement in any syntactically correct Vesta model
must be a <tt><a href="statements.html#return">return</a></tt> statement.</li>

<li>
Although it seems silly in this case, the <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
function returns a value. All functions return some value, <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
just happens to return whatever it printed.</li>

<li>
We returned the value that <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
returned. We didn't have to do this, but we did have to do
<i>something</i>
with the value it returned. Since it's a functional language, calling a
function is <b>not</b> a kind of statement, only a kind of expression.</li>
</ol>
In a functional language, calling a function can't have any side effects,
so if you didn't do anything with its return value, why call it at all?
This particular case is a bit weird, because <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
obviously does have a side effect: it produces output on the terminal.
However, it's important to remember this principle.
<h3>
<a NAME="Importing"></a>Importing Other Models</h3>
Create another file in your package named <tt>import.ves</tt>, and put
this inside it:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000"><a href="models.html#import">import
</a>&nbsp; hi = hello.ves;
{
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> hi();
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Go back to your shell and <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
-trace import.ves</tt>. You'll see something like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998

Return value of `import.ves':
&nbsp; "Hello World!"

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `import.ves' was successful.

Function call graph:
&nbsp; 0. import.ves: miss
&nbsp; 1. /vesta/example.com/play/jsmith_experiment/checkout/2/6/hello.ves: <b>miss
</b>&nbsp; 1. /vesta/example.com/play/jsmith_experiment/checkout/2/6/hello.ves: <b>hit</b> (ci=35792)
&nbsp; 1. /vesta/example.com/play/jsmith_experiment/checkout/2/6/hello.ves: add (ci=18548)
&nbsp; 0. import.ves: add (ci=18549)</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the return value is the same as it was when you evaluated
<tt>hello.ves</tt>.
<tt>import.ves</tt>
imports the model
<tt>hello.ves</tt>. It assigns a value which represents
<tt>hello.ves</tt>
to a variable named <tt>hi</tt>. It turns out that this value is of <a href="data-types.html#function">type
<tt>function</tt></a>.
<tt>import.ves</tt>
then calls that function, and returns the value it returns.
<p>There is something important to note here: the output from the
<tt><a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a></tt>
function (called by <tt>hello.ves</tt>) is missing. Where did it go? Into
the function cache of course! Since you recently evaluated
<tt>hello.ves</tt>,
the call to
<tt>hello.ves</tt> resulted in a cache hit. This means that
it didn't actually evaluate <tt>hello.ves</tt>, it just returned the cached
result value.&nbsp; The function call graph at the end of the output (which
was produced by use of the -trace command-line flag) shows the details
of what happened.&nbsp; Evaluating <tt>import.ves</tt> was a cache miss,
but that evaluating <tt>hello.ves</tt> was a cache hit.
<p>Just for fun, do <tt><a href="../man/html/vimports.1.html">vimports</a>
import.ves</tt> at the command line.&nbsp; It'll show you that <tt>import.ves</tt>
imports <tt>hello.ves</tt>.
<h3>
<a NAME="Bindings"></a>Fun with Bindings</h3>
If you only understand one of <a href="data-types.html">the Vesta data
types</a>, it should be <a href="data-types.html#binding">bindings</a>.&nbsp;
They are central to the way files and directories are manipulated in Vesta
system models.&nbsp; They are used to provide source files to tools (such
as compilers).&nbsp; They are also how generated files are returned from
tools, and the way files are returned to the user (to be shipped after
the successful evaluation of a model).
<p>Create another file in your package named <tt>binding.ves</tt>, and
put this inside it:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; b1 = [x=1];
&nbsp; b2 = [y=2];
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b1);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b1/x);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b2);
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> b1 + b2;
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The first two assignment statements create bindings.&nbsp; Whenever
you see something enclosed in square brackets, that's a binding.&nbsp;
Both of the bindings created contain a single name/value pair.&nbsp; You've
probably already figured out that the first one binds the value 1 to the
name "x", and the second one binds the value 2 to the name "y".
<p>The second print statement uses a <a href="expressions.html#BindingLookup">binding
lookup expression</a>.&nbsp; The expression <tt>b1/x</tt> means "look up
the value associated with the name 'x' in the binding <tt>b1</tt>".&nbsp;
Since <tt>b1</tt> binds the name "x" to the value 1, this evaluates to
1.&nbsp; In more complex models, you may see examples of this where the
binding is generated by some other expression (such as a <a href="expressions.html#FunctionCall">function
call</a>) or even another binding lookup expression (which makes it possible
to do nested lookups into sub-bindings, sub-sub-bindings, etc.).
<p>&nbsp;The return statement uses the binding overlay operation (which
looks just like adding two bindings together) to combine the two bindings.
<p>Now <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
binding.ves</tt>. You'll see something like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998
[ x=1 ]
1
[ y=2 ]

Return value of `binding.ves':
&nbsp; [ x=1, y=2 ]

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `binding.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You probably could've guessed what the result would be: a binding with
two name/value pairs, combining the two in the bindings <tt>b1</tt> and
<tt>b2</tt>.
<p>Let's make some modifications to <tt>binding.ves</tt>:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; b1 = [x=1];
&nbsp; b2 = [y=2];
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b1);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b2);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b1 + b2);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b2 + b1);
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> (b1 + b2) == (b2 + b1);
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
binding.ves</tt> again, you'll see something like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998
[ x=1 ]
[ y=2 ]
[ x=1, y=2 ]
[ y=2, x=1 ]

Return value of `binding.ves':
&nbsp; FALSE

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `binding.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This illustrates a subtle point about bindings: the name/value pairs
they contain have an order.&nbsp; That's why <font color="#000000"><tt>b1
+ b2</tt> is not equivalent to <tt>b2 + b1</tt>.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Before we're done, let's do a couple more tricks
with bindings.&nbsp; Edit </font><tt>binding.ves</tt> one more time:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; b1 = [x=1];
&nbsp; b2 = [y=2];
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b1);
&nbsp; junk = <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(b2);
&nbsp; b3 = [ coord/z = 3 ];
&nbsp; junk = _print(b3);
&nbsp; b4 = [ coord = b1 + b2 ];
&nbsp; junk = _print(b4);
&nbsp; junk = _print(b3 + b4);
&nbsp; junk = _print(b3 ++ b4);
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> (b3 + b4) == (b3 ++ b4);
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The assignment to the variable <tt>b3</tt> uses a shortcut syntax for
creating nested bindings.&nbsp; It actually assigns <tt>b3</tt> to a binding
with the name <tt>coord</tt> bound to another binding which has <tt>z</tt>
bound to 3.&nbsp; The following statement is semantically equivalent:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">&nbsp; b3 = [ coord = [ z = 3 ] ];</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The value assigned to <tt>b4</tt> is similar, but its binding has the
name <tt>coord</tt> bound to the result of <tt>b1 + b2</tt>.
<p>Now <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
binding.ves</tt> again:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998
[ x=1 ]
[ y=2 ]
[ coord=[ z=3 ] ]
[ coord=[ x=1, y=2 ] ]
[ coord=[ x=1, y=2 ] ]
[ coord=[ z=3, x=1, y=2 ] ]

Return value of `binding.ves':
&nbsp; FALSE

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `binding.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This shows us another important point about manipulating bindings: the
difference between the overlay operator (<tt>+</tt>) and the recursive
overlay operator (<tt>++</tt>).&nbsp; You'll notice that in <font color="#000000"><tt>b3
+ b4</tt>, the value bound to <tt>coord</tt> in <tt>b4</tt> (<tt>b1 + b2</tt>)
completely replaces the value bound to <tt>coord</tt> in <tt>b3</tt> (<tt>[
z = 3 ]</tt>).&nbsp; However, in <tt>b3 ++ b4</tt>, the two sub-bindings
bound to <tt>coord</tt> are merged.&nbsp; The overlay operator only "sees"
one level of binding: it simply replaces any names bound in both bindings
with the value bound in the second operand (thus, <tt>coord = b1 + b2</tt>
replaces <tt>coord = [ z = 3]</tt>).&nbsp; However, the recursive overlay
operator will recurse into sub-bindings (and sub-sub-bindings, etc.), merging
the bindings at all levels.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="Dot"></a>The Deal With Dot (.)</h3>
There's a special variable in the Vesta system modeling language language:
"." (normally called "dot").&nbsp; (<font color="#000000">The <a href="syntax.html#Identifiers">Vesta
identifier syntax</a> does allow variable names like this.)&nbsp; </font>Every
function has an implicit final parameter which defines the value of dot.&nbsp;
When <a href="expressions.html#FunctionCall">a function is called</a>,
if no value is specified for this implicit parameter, it takes the value
of dot in the calling scope.&nbsp; <font color="#000000">Even models, which
have no explicit function arguments, take one argument which defines the
value of dot.&nbsp; </font>In most cases, dot is implicitly passed into
a function from the calling function.
<p>Let's illustrate how this works with two of the models we used earlier.&nbsp;
Edit <tt>import.ves</tt> to look like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000"><a href="models.html#import">import
</a>&nbsp; hi = hello.ves;
{
&nbsp; . = [ msg = "Hello World!" ];
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> hi();
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Before calling <tt>hello.ves</tt>, this assigns dot a binding value
with a single name bound to a text literal.&nbsp; When we call the function
<tt>hi</tt>
in the return statement, this will get implicitly passed into
<tt>hello.ves</tt>
and become the value of dot when its body is evaluated.
<p>Now edit <tt>hello.ves</tt> to look like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">{
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> <a href="primitive-functions/_assert-_print.html#_print(any,int,bool)">_print</a>(./msg);
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>We've replaced the text literal for the message with a reference to
<tt>./msg</tt>.&nbsp;
In other words, the message is not hard-wired into hello.ves, but is instead
taken from its environment.
<p>If you <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a>
import.ves</tt>., you'll see the same message it used to deliver (since
that's what we assigned to <tt>./msg</tt>).&nbsp; After doing that, change
the message test in <tt>import.ves</tt> and evaluate it again to see that
it changes the result of the evaluation.&nbsp; This concept is important
in the next section, so play around with it a bit to convince yourself
that it works.
<h3>
<a NAME="std_env"></a>The Story Behind <tt>std_env</tt></h3>
Now let's do something a little more typical of what you'll see in other
packages. Create another file in your package named <tt>.main.ves</tt>,
and put this inside it:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">from /vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i386 <a href="models.html#import">import</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; std_env/8;
{
&nbsp; . = std_env()/env_build();
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> ./target_platform
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This introduces several new things, so let's go over them one at a time:
<ol>
<li>
We're importing a model from another package.&nbsp; In order to do so,
we have to tell Vesta where to find it.&nbsp; In fact, we have to tell
Vesta the complete path to it, including the version of the package that
we want to import.</li>

<li>
The <tt>from ... import</tt> construct is a short-hand for importing models
with long paths. What we see in this model:</li>

<blockquote><tt>from /vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i386 import std_env/8;</tt></blockquote>
Is equivalent to:
<blockquote><tt>import std_env = /vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i386/std_env/8/build.ves;</tt></blockquote>
It's most useful when you need to import several models with with a common
path prefix, like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>from /vesta/example.com/shared/path import
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foo/7;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bar/12;</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>
Unlike the previous example, we don't specify the name of the Vesta model
to import.&nbsp; If you import an entire directory, you get the <tt>build.ves</tt>
file inside that directory (or an error if there isn't one).&nbsp; So in
this case, we're actually importing <font color="#000000"><tt>/vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i386/std_env/8/build.ves</tt>,
even though the text "build.ves" doesn't appear anywhere in the model.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">We don't give a variable name to assign the model
to.&nbsp; If you omit the variable name and equals sign, the first component
of the path after the word "import" is used.&nbsp; This means that the
variable <tt>std_env</tt> holds the <a href="data-types.html#function">function</a>
corresponding to the model <tt>std_env/8/build.ves</tt>.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The assignment statement (the first statement in
the body of the model) sets the value of dot.&nbsp; This is how the "environment"
(including standard libraries, the bridges which invoke compilers, and
other common functions and data) gets passed around between models.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The return statement uses an expression which indexes
into the value assigned to dot.&nbsp; (For now, ignore the details of the
assignment statement.)&nbsp; The value assigned to dot is a <a href="data-types.html#binding">binding</a>.&nbsp;
The expression in the return statement looks up the value assigned to the
name "target_platform" in the <a href="data-types.html#binding">binding</a>
assigned to dot.</font></li>
</ol>
<font color="#000000">Now go to the command line and do</font> <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a></tt>
(note the lack of a parameter naming a specific model file).&nbsp; You
should see this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#000000">
<pre><font color="#FFFFFF">Vesta evaluator, version 2.21, Sept 23, 1998

Return value of `.main.ves':
&nbsp; "Linux2.4-i386"

No errors were reported.

The evaluation of `.main.ves' was successful.</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the value assigned to <font color="#000000"><tt>./target_platform</tt>
is the string "Linux2.4-i386".&nbsp; We didn't need to tell </font><tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a></tt>
that it was <tt>.main.ves</tt> that we wanted to evaluate: that's the default
model to evaluate.
<p><font color="#000000">The value generated by the <tt>std_env</tt> model
(and stored in the variable dot) is big and complex.&nbsp; (If you're feeling
adventurous, you can print it out and look at it.)&nbsp; It contains all
kinds of things like standard libraries and their associated header files,
the bridge functions for invoking different compilers, command line options
for different tools, and even compiler executables.&nbsp; (Try looking
at <tt>./Cxx/expert/root</tt>: it's the filesystem used when compiling C++.)&nbsp;
Normally, you call <tt>std_env</tt> to generate this for you in <tt>.main.ves</tt>,
then you implicitly pass dot to another model (often <tt>build.ves</tt>)
to actually do some compilation.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Of course, <tt>std_env</tt> is not strictly necessary,
it's just a convention.&nbsp; Every model could import all the different
pieces it needs (like compilers and libraries), but centralizing all this
common stuff in <tt>std_env</tt> makes most models much simpler.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="InlineSource"></a>Inline Source Code and Other Hacks Your Mother
Wouldn't Approve Of</h3>
I think that one of the best ways to understand a language is to do something
out of the ordinary with it.&nbsp; It's important to understand not just
the syntax and semantics of a language, but where its boundaries lie:
what can and can't you do with it?&nbsp; We'll push on the Vesta system
modeling language language in this exercise, and see some things you might
not normally encounter.
<p>Let's keep working on <tt>.main.ves</tt>:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

&nbsp; . = std_env()/env_build();
&nbsp; code = "#include &lt;iostream.h>\n" +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "main(){cout&lt;&lt;\"Hi there\\n\";}\n";
&nbsp; <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> ./Cxx/program("foo", [ foo.cxx = code ], [],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;./libs/c/clib_umb&gt;);
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The variable code is a <a href="data-types.html#text">text string</a>.&nbsp;
I've broken up the string into two lines to make it a little more readable,
and concatenated the pieces together with the <tt>+</tt> operator.&nbsp;
As you can see, it is a complete C++ program, which one might ordinarily
format like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">#include &lt;iostream.h>

main()
{
&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "Hi there\n";
}</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I've just compressed it down a bit by removing most of the whitespace
one would ordinarily see.
<p>The return statement invokes a function which is part of the standard
environment.&nbsp; Specifically, it looks up the <a href="data-types.html#function">function</a>
bound to the name <tt>program</tt> inside the binding bound to <tt>Cxx</tt>
inside the binding assigned to the variable dot.&nbsp; This function compiles
and links a C++ program.&nbsp; It requires four arguments:
<ol>
<li>
The name of the executable to produce (in other words, the filename the
linker should be told to generate)</li>

<li>
A <a href="data-types.html#binding">binding</a> of source files to be compiled</li>

<li>
A <a href="data-types.html#binding">binding</a> of header files included
by the source code to be compiled</li>

<li>
A <a href="data-types.html#list">list</a> of libraries to link with</li>
</ol>
We'll call our program "<tt>foo</tt>", so that's the first argument.&nbsp;
For the source files, we'll have just one, named <tt>foo.cxx</tt>, and
filled with the text in the variable <tt>code</tt>.&nbsp; We don't have
any header files of our own, so we pass the empty binding for the third
argument.&nbsp; We'll use some standard libraries such as the C++ and C
runtime libraries.&nbsp; (Don't worry too much about the fourth argument.&nbsp;
It just grabs libraries from the standard environment and puts them in
a <a href="data-types.html#list">list</a>.)
<p>Let's look a little more closely at the second parameter.&nbsp; The
first thing to note is that the source code we're compiling is not stored
in a file, it's inlined in the system model.&nbsp; This is not the way
one usually deals with source code under Vesta.&nbsp; Usually, the source
code would be in a separate file and imported with a <a href="models.html#files">files
clause</a> at the beginning of the model.&nbsp; However, once you bring
in a file with a files clause, it's just a <a href="data-types.html#text">text
value</a>, indistinguishable from one defined with a literal in a system
model.&nbsp; In fact, <b>all files manipulated by the Vesta evaluator are
text values</b>, including compiler executables, object files, and other
tool result files. This means that they're interchangeable, so there's
nothing preventing us from putting source code in a system model as we've
done here.
<p>The second thing to note about the binding we pass to
<font color="#000000"><tt>./Cxx/program</tt>
is that it binds a filename (<tt>foo.cxx</tt>) to the file's contents (the
C++ program stored in the variable <tt>code</tt>).&nbsp; If you think about
it, this is very similar to a directory in the filesystem, which also associates
names (filenames) with values (file contents).&nbsp; In fact, as far as
Vesta is concerned,
<b>a binding is a directory</b>.&nbsp; Just as text
values and files are interchangeable, so are bindings and directories.&nbsp;
(You might want to take a minute to think about these two points, as they
have a lot of implications.&nbsp; If you don't get it right now, don't
worry about it.)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Let's go do a</font> <tt><a href="../man/html/vmake.1.html">vmake</a></tt>.&nbsp;
Assuming you don't get a cache hit (which might happen if someone else
did this exercise recently), you'll see this:

<p>As you can see, the program was compiled and linked into an executable.&nbsp;
Go ahead and ship it somewhere and run it to convince yourself this worked.
<h3>
<a NAME="RunTool"></a>Running Tools Under Vesta</h3>
Now let's do one more thing with this little program: invoke it from within
Vesta, just like compilers are invoked.&nbsp; Edit <tt>.main.ves</tt> one
more time:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=LEFT BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<pre><font color="#000000">from /vesta/vestasys.org/platforms/linux/redhat/i386 <a href="models.html#import">import

         "main(){cout&lt;&lt;\"Hi there\\n\";}\n";
  exe = ./Cxx/program("foo", [ foo.cxx = code ], [],
                      &lt;./libs/c/clib_umb&gt;);
  cmd = &lt;"foo">;
  . ++= [ root/.WD = exe ];

                /*stdout_treatment=*/ "value");
  <a href="statements.html#return">return</a> [foo.out = r/stdout];
}</font></pre>
</td>

<p>Let's go over the changes here:
<ol>
<li>
Instead of returning the program generated by <font color="#000000"><tt>./Cxx/program</tt>,
we capture it in a variable named <tt>exe</tt>.&nbsp; If you were to look
at it, you'd see that it's a <a href="data-types.html#binding">binding</a>
with the name <tt>foo</tt> bound to a <a href="data-types.html#text">text</a>
value, which is a string of the data in the executable we've compiled.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">We create a <a href="data-types.html#list">list</a>
of strings to represent the command line we want Vesta to invoke for us
and store it in the variable <tt>cmd</tt>.&nbsp; In this case, the command-line
is very simple: it's just one string, "foo", the name of our executable.</font></li>

<li><font color="#000000">We modify the value of dot with the in-place
recursive overlay operator (<tt>++=</tt>).&nbsp; What we're actually accomplishing
here is making our executable available to the tool invocation.&nbsp; <tt>./root/.WD</tt>
will be the working directory when we invoke a tool.&nbsp; Since <i>bindings
are directories</i>, we can merge the binding in <tt>exe</tt> (which contains
our executable) into this binding.&nbsp; This makes it so that the working
directory will contain our executable <tt>foo</tt> when we run our command-line.</font>
</li>

<li>
We also merge the C and C++ run-time libraries into <tt>./root</tt>.
This is necessary, because our executable <tt>foo</tt> may need shared
libraries for the C and C++ run-time library.
</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">We invoke the primitive function <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_run_tool.html#_run_tool">_run_tool</a></tt>.&nbsp;
This is how all commands are executed by Vesta (compilers, the linker,
etc.).&nbsp; We pass it a few arguments: the target platform (<tt>./target_platform</tt>),
the command line (which we constructed in <tt>cmd</tt>), the text for the
standard input stream (empty in this case), and an indication of how it
should treat the standard output.&nbsp; The important one here is that
we tell it to return the standard output to us as a value.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">As the result of the model, we return a file named
<tt>foo.out</tt>
with the standard output from our invocation of <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_run_tool.html#_run_tool">_run_tool</a></tt>
(from <tt>r/stdout</tt>) as its contents.</font></li>
</ol>
<font color="#000000">If you evaluate this model and ship its result,
you can look at the contents of <tt>foo.out</tt>, and see the string the
C++ code printed.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The way <tt>./root</tt> affects <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_run_tool.html#_run_tool">_run_tool</a></tt>
is very significant, so we should talk about it a little more.&nbsp; Vesta
builds use a technique called <b>filesystem encapsulation</b>.&nbsp; Every
time a tool is invoked under Vesta (every time <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_run_tool.html#_run_tool">_run_tool</a></tt>
is called), Vesta creates a temporary filesystem derived from the binding in
<tt>./root</tt>.&nbsp;
Vesta uses the UNIX system call <tt>chroot(2)</tt> to make this temporary
filesystem the entire universe, as far as the running tool can see.&nbsp;
(The directory defined by <tt>./root</tt> becomes equivalent to <tt>/</tt>
in the UNIX filesystem.)&nbsp; This makes it possible for Vesta to have
complete control over which files the tool reads and to be able to know
which files the tool has written.&nbsp; Although we don't demonstrate it
here, a call to <tt><a href="primitive-functions/_run_tool.html#_run_tool">_run_tool</a></tt>
that generates files will return them in the form of a binding to text
values.&nbsp; This is also how Vesta does precise dependency checking.&nbsp;
Since it provides the filesystem a tool sees, it knows every file read
by the tool invocation, which allows it to determine exactly which sources
a given build result depended upon.</font>
