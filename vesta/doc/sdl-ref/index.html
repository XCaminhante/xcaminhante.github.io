<h1>
Vesta SDL Programmer's Reference</h1>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Vesta System Description Language is a <a
href="functional.html">functional
programming language</a> used to define the instructions for the
automated processing of source files through a series of tools
(i.e. building a program from source code).&nbsp; Evaluating a Vesta
SDL program can be thought of as analogous to running <tt>make</tt>
(although SDL is much more powerful than <tt>make</tt>'s description
language).
</p>

<p>
This document is a tutorial and reference for the Vesta SDL.&nbsp;
It's intended to make it a little easier for people new to the languag
to get started than the documentation provided in <a
href="../sdl-spec/index.html">the language
specification</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Sections</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="about.html">About the Guide</a> - A little history, and a few
caveats.  (It's short, and you should really read it.)
</li>


<li>
<i>Explanatory Dialogues</i> - These sections will take you through certain
aspects of the language and how it is used.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a> - Probably the best place to
start.&nbsp; Gets your feet wet with a few Vesta evaluator models.</li>

<li>
<a href="bridge-dissection.html">Bridge Dissection</a> - Look inside a
simple bridge.&nbsp; Both its structure and how it works are described
in detail.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<i>Reference</i> - These sections describe the language in detail.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="syntax.html">Syntax</a> - The basic syntax of the Vesta SDL: Comments,
identifiers, white-space, statement blocks, etc.</li>

<li>
<a href="data-types.html">Data Types </a>- The fundamental data types supported
by the language and how to express more complex aggregate types</li>

<li>
<a href="expressions.html">Expressions and Operators</a> - The basic expressions
and operators</li>

the files and imports clauses</li>
</ul>

<li>
<i>Advanced Material</i> - Once you've got the basics down, these will
help you improve your skills.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="caching.html">Controlling Cache Behavior</a> - How to make your
models use the cache server appropriately.&nbsp; Anyone writing bridges
should probably read this.</li>

<a href="gotchas.html">Gotchas</a> - If you find yourself scratching your
head, look here.&nbsp; In fact, look here to prevent unnecessary head scratching.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
References</h3>

The <a href="../../index.html">Vesta home page</a> is a good place to start.&nbsp;
There is a much more precise definition of the Vesta System
Description Language provided in <a
href="../sdl-spec/index.html">the language
specification</a>.&nbsp; (However, this document is intended to be a
bit easier to read than that one, so you should probably start with
this one first.)&nbsp; You may also want to take a look at the man
pages for some of the tools used when working with Vesta models:
<ul>
<li>
Run the model evaluator: <a href="../man/html/vesta.1.html">vesta(1)</a></li>

<li>
Determine which other models are imported by a model: <a href="../man/html/vimports.1.html">vimports(1)</a></li>

<li>
Update model imports to their latest versions: <a href="../man/html/vupdate.1.html">vupdate(1)</a></li>
</ul>
There are also some man pages which document the conventions used in the
C/C++ bridges developed by the Vesta team.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.InstantWeb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=ymmv">YMMV</a>,
depending on how closely the bridges you work with follow the same conventions,
but they're worth reading in any case.)
<ul>
<li>
Writing standard user models:
<a href="../man/html/vmodels.5.html">vmodels(5)</a></li>

<li>
Organization of libraries in Vesta:
<a href="../man/html/vlibraries.5.html">vlibraries(5)</a></li>

<li>
Building with overrides:
<a href="../man/html/voverrides.5.html">voverrides(5)</a></li>

<li>
Standard types:
<a href="../man/html/vtypes.5.html">vtypes(5)</a></li>
</ul>
