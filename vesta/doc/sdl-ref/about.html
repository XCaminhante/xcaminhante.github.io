    <h1>About the Vesta SDL Programmer's Reference</h1>

<p>

I first began working on this document in 1999.  It started as a way
to help other people in the Alpha Development Group (where I worked)
get up to speed on writing build descriptions in Vesta SDL.  I
extended it on an as-needed and as-time-allowed basis.

</p>

<p>

Fast-forward 2.5 years: Vesta is released as free software!  Truly an
historic moment (well, at least for Vesta), but not one I was thinking
about when I started writing this guide.  Consequently, you may find
any or all of the following in it:

</p>

<ul>

<li>
Information specific to Tru64 UNIX (the only platform Vesta supported
when I began writing this guide).
</li>

<li>
Out of date information (e.g. statements that primitive functions
return the deprecated <tt>ERR</tt> value when they really cause a
run-time error that stops the evaluation).  (When in doubt, refer to
<a href="../sdl-spec/index.html">the language
specification</a>.)
</li>

<li>
Spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and inconsistent typographical
conventions.
</li>

</ul>

<p>

I'm doing my best to bring everything in the guide up to date and
clean it up, but it is inevitably a work in progress (as are all
things on the web).  Please bear with me in this [exciting!] time of
transition for Vesta.  Of course corrections and suggestions for
improvement are always welcome.

</p>
