<H3>Description</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<I>mtex2man</I> is a filter that reads a file in <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20051124000319/http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/mtex/mtex.7.html">mtex(7)</A> format from its standard input, and writes a <I>man</I>-format file to
standard output suitable for viewing with nroff(1)/troff(1) and the man(7) or
man.nopage(7) macro packages.<P>

<I>mtex2man</I> is written entirely in LIM (see lim(1)).

<H3>Special Characters</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

There are two special characters for the man output format. Here
are the characters and the strings they are translated to by
mtex2man(1):<P>

"<TT>-</TT>" becomes "<TT>\-</TT>"<BR>
"<TT>\</TT>" becomes "<TT>\\</TT>"
<BR>
<P>

To prevent the first character from being translated within the
scope of a <I>roff</I> environment, you must escape it with a
<TT>\</TT> (backslash) character.<P>

Since the backslash character is the escape character used by mtex,
the way to signal one in the input is by escaping it. Hence, the
second translation listed above says that "<TT>\\</TT>" in the input
become "<TT>\\</TT>" in the output.

<H3>Diagnostics</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

See the <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20051124000319/http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/mtex/mtex.7.html#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</A> section of the
mtex(7) manpage for a complete description.

<H3>Bugs</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The <TT>\tt</TT> command for typesetting in fixed-width font is currently
ignored.<P>

For now, there is no way to produce a single <TT>\</TT> (backslash)
character in a <I>roff</I> environment.<P>

An escaped backslash character (<TT>\\</TT>) should not be used in
arguments to the <TT>\item</TT> command within the <TT>description</TT>
environment. There seems to be a problem with using backslash in
arguments to certain man(7) macros.<P>

The <TT>"</TT> (double-quote) character should not be used in arguments to the
<TT>\manpage</TT> and <TT>\section</TT> commands. This problem seems to be due to a
mistake in the design of nroff(1)/troff(1), which uses this character
literally in some contexts but as a method of quoting in others.<P>

Links are not indicated in any way.
