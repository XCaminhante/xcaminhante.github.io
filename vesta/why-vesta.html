    <h1>Why You Should be Using Vesta</h1>

<blockquote>

&quot;<tt>make</tt> was a really good project for a college student

<p>

If you're wondering why anyone would chose Vesta over other
alternatives (e.g. CVS+<tt>make</tt>), here's a summary of some of the
reasons that Vesta users find most compelling.

</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<b>Automatic dependency detection.</b> It's complete, precise,
fine-grained, and language-independent.  Even dependencies on the
compiler version, compiler and linker command line options, and system
libraries are recorded.  The user never needs to even think about
dependencies, and can't cause problems with incorrect ones.  You don't
need help from a hack like <tt>makedepend</tt>.  Dependencies aren't
based on time-stamps, so you don't have to worry about clock skew or
partially-written result files.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>User-independent builds.</b> Builds take place in an encapsulated
environment.  The user can't make or break a build with their personal
environment or other settings.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Guaranteed repeatability of builds.</b> Builds completely specify
everything that affects their outcome, including the exact versions of
all source files, as well as compiler versions, library versions, etc.
This makes it possible to perform any build you've ever done in the
past and be certain that you will get identical results.

(This can be a big help with finding and fixing bugs and other QA
issues; with Vesta you never have to worry that a bug has been masked
rather than fixed by intervening changes, because you can always
re-build the exact version that exhibited the problem.)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Collaboration features.</b> The Vesta

<a href="doc/man/html/vrepl.1.html">replicator</a> makes it easy to
share source versions, and even complete builds between different
installations.  Also, the guarantee of precise repeatability is
maintained <em>even when a build is performed at a remote site</em>
from a replica.

The

<a href="doc/man/html/repos-ui.1.html">repository user-interface
tools</a> are designed for collaboration with remote repositories: the
checkout and tool can automatically get a local working copy of a
remote package (assuming you have permission), and the checkin tool
will replicate the checked in version back to the remote master
repository.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>File-system interface to the repository.</b>

All versions are accessible through a file-system which users can
access with all the normal tools they're used to.  It's simple to
<tt>grep</tt> across versions, <tt>diff</tt> between them, and use
Emacs' <tt>ediff</tt> and other sophisticated conflict resolution
tools.  (More creative users can write complex scripts to take
advantage of this.)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Shared cache of build results.</b>

Thanks to automatic dependency detection and the user-independence of
builds, there's no problem with sharing build results between users.

The build work done by every developer is &quot;remembered&quot;in a
per-site <a href="doc/man/html/VCache.1.html">Vesta cache</a>.

Since the cache is shared by all developers at the same
site, each can benefit from the work done by the others' builds.

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>It's high-performance.</b>

The <a href="doc/man/html/vesta.1.html">Vesta builder</a> is faster
than <tt>make</tt>.  It can run with multiple threads, and even
execute compilers and other tools on multiple hosts simultaneously.
(This can increase build throughput significantly, making developers
more productive.)

Checkout operations are constant-time, because the repository stores a
complete copy of each source file.  There's no latency for copying on
checkout or checkin, because working copies are managed by the
repository file-system.  No storage is consumed by a checkout until
the user saves changes to a source file, because the repository uses
copy-on-write for working copies.

(See chapter 9 of

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094525/http://gatekeeper.research.compaq.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/abstracts/src-rr-177.html">the research report</a>

for more details on Vesta's performance.)

<li>
<p>
<b>It's free.</b> Vesta is distributed free of charge under the terms
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser
General Public License</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>

<b>It's extensible.</b>

The <a href="doc/man/html/repos-ui.1.html">command-line tools</a> make
it easy to write scripts that perform complex operations.  Vesta's

<a href="doc/man/html/vesta-intro.1.html#mutable_attributes">flexible
attribute system</a> makes it possible to associate all manner of
meta-information with the repository's contents.  With the C++ APIs,
one can build high-performance extensions or write new tools to
perform operations which the existing tools don't.  (And since Vesta
is distributed under the

<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>,

extensions are not forced to adopt the same licensing terms.)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>It's mature.</b> Vesta has had over 10 years of research and
development, and over 4 years of real-world use by a very demanding
group.  It's well-tested, stable, scalable, and designed from the
ground up to be fault-tolerant.  It was designed specifically to
overcome the limitations of existing systems, and is competitive with
several commercial offerings.
