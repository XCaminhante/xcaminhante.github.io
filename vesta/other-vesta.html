<H1>Other things called <I>Vesta</I></H1>

<P>Naming a project can be almost as hard as naming a baby.  This
page illustrates one of the difficulties: the humorous and sometimes
confusing juxtapositions that arise when two different entities
are given the same name.

<P>The Vesta project was named for the Roman goddess of the hearth.
From the Random House dictionary (1966):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Vesta</STRONG>
1. the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth, worshiped in a temple
   containing an altar on which a sacred fire was kept burning under the
   care of vestal virgins: identified with the Greek Hestia.
2. Astron. the third largest and one of the four brightest asteroids.
3. (l.c.) Brit. a short friction match with a wood or wax shank.
4. a girl's given name.
[akin to Gk hestia hearth, household]

<P>The Vesta truck on our home page belongs to <A HREF="http://www.vesta.no/">a Norwegian insurance company named Vesta</A>.
Jim Horning happened to see it on the
street while visiting Norway and photographed it for the project.
Later we did an <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</A> search and
found the truck's owner.

<P>The Vesta life preserver above has a similar story.  Marc H. Brown
saw it while travelling in Scandanavia.  Like Jim, he photographed
it for us but had no idea why it was labelled <I>vesta</I>.  Later we
found out that it came from the same insurance company as the truck;
the life preserver is another of their logos, and they gave out real ship
life preservers as a promotion.

<P>Occasional web searches also turned up a weird and wonderful
assortment of other things named <I>Vesta</I>.  Here are some of them:
