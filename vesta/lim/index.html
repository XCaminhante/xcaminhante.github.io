<H2>Overview</H2>

<P> LIM is a text processing language in the general family of lex, yacc,
sed, awk, and trans, but is based on Dijkstra's calculus of guarded
commands.  The name is an acronym for Language of the Included Miracle,
because LIM programs can violate the so-called Law of the Excluded
Miracle.  For details see "A Discipline of Programming", Edsger W.
Dijkstra, Prentice-Hall, 1976, and "A generalization of Dijkstra's
calculus", Greg Nelson, Trans. on Programming Languages and Systems,
October 1989, or
<A HREF="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/abstracts/src-rr-016.html">SRC Research Report 16</A>.

<P> A LIM command may be <I>guarded</I> by a predicate. The command is
said to <I>fail</I> if the predicate is false when the command is
executed. The main novelty in LIM is that failing commands never have
side effects. If a long computation has side effects and then fails,
it is as though the side effects never happened. This property of the
language makes it easy to write parsers and pretty-printers, since
they require the ability to speculatively perform some action. In
fact, the LIM distribution includes a pretty-printer for the LIM
language that is itself written in LIM.

<H2>Downloading LIM</H2>

<P> LIM is written in C, and uses lex/yacc or flex/bison. It has been
successfully built on the Digital Ultrix and Digital Unix operating
systems. It should compile on most other Unix platforms.

<P> To download LIM, follow these steps:

<UL>
<LI>
Make a new directory called "lim".
<P>
<LI>
Select the following link, and tell your browser to save the
downloaded file to your new "lim" directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="lim.tar.Z"><CODE>lim.tar.Z</CODE></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI>
cd into your new "lim" directory. It should contain the single file
"<CODE>lim.tar.Z</CODE>". If it instead contains the file
"<CODE>lim.tar</CODE>", then your browser has automatically
uncompressed the file, and you can skip the following step.
<P>
<LI>
Run "<CODE>uncompress lim.tar.Z</CODE>" on the downloaded file.
<P>
<LI>
Run "<CODE>tar xvf lim.tar</CODE>" on the resulting tar file to extract
the LIM sources.
<P>
<LI>
Run "<CODE>rm lim.tar</CODE>" to remove the tar file.
</UL>

<H2>Installing LIM</H2>

<P> Once you have downloaded and unpacked the LIM sources, follow
these steps from your "lim" directory to build LIM on your system:

<UL>
<LI>
The LIM pretty-printer, <I>pplim</I>, requires that three LIM
programs be installed in a centralized lib directory. By default,
<I>pplim</I> expects these scripts to be installed in
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/lim</CODE>. If you plan to install them somewhere
else, edit the file "<CODE>pp/pplim.sh</CODE>. Replace the pathname
"<CODE>/usr/local/lib/lim</CODE>" on the third line of that script
with the absolute path of the directory where you eventually plan to
install the scripts.
<P>
<LI>
From your "lim" directory, run "<CODE>make</CODE>". This will create
a derived directory named by your machine's architecture. It's name
is formed by running "<CODE>machine</CODE>".
<P>
<LI>
You may now want to copy the LIM executables, man pages, and library
files to centralized bin, man, and lib directories. If your derived
directory is denoted by <I>arch</I>, the files you may want to copy
are:
<P>
<DL>
<DT>To centralized <CODE>bin</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE><I>arch</I>/lim</CODE> - LIM executable
<LI> <CODE><I>arch</I>/pplim</CODE> - LIM pretty-printer
</UL>
<P>
<DT>To centralized <CODE>man/man1</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>lim.1</CODE> - lim(1) man page
<LI> <CODE>pp/pplim.1</CODE> - pplim(1) man page
</UL>
<P>
<DT>To centralized <CODE>lib/lim</CODE>:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>pp/format.lim</CODE> - formats pretty-printer output
<LI> <CODE>pp/lex.lim</CODE> - parses input for pretty-printer
<LI> <CODE>pp/pp.lim</CODE> - LIM pretty-printer
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
The directory in which the last three files are installed should match
the directory in the <CODE>pp/pplim.sh</CODE> script that you edited
in the first step of this section.
</UL>

<P> Once you have successfully installed lim, you may be interested in
downloading and installing mtex, a set of LIM scripts for producing
man pages in HTML and nroff format from a single LaTeX-like source
format. For more information about mtex, see the
<!-- Original mtex home page: http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/mtex/ -->
