    <h1>vestasys.org Network Architecture</h1>

    <p>This document describes details of the vestasys.org network and
    established methods which allow authorized users to connect other
    networks to it.  The goals of the configuration described are:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>
        <i>Protecting the repository that has mastership of the Vesta
        sources.</i> Secure authentication in the repository has not
        yet been implemented, and we have not performed any security
        auditing of the repository's code.  For the time being, we're
        going to err on the side of caution and rely on traditional
        firewalling and VPN techniques to restrict access to secure
        channels for authenticated clients.  A separate repository
        (with mastership of nothing) will be used for allowing anyone
        on the Internet to replicate new versions of the Vesta source
        code.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Enabling continued collaboration.</i> While we want to
        protect the repository, it must be possible for contributors
        to access it and perform remote checkouts to and checkins from
        their local repositories running at other locations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Protecting contributors from each other.</i> Allowing
        remote checkout/checkin means that the central repository must
        be able to contact the repositories running at participating
        sites where development takes place.  However, the access
        should be limited to that which is necessary to facilitate
        collaboration work on Vesta itself.  It must not provide any
        means by which malicious users could gain unauthorized access
        to participating sites.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>VPN Connections</h2>

      <p>
	The method for connecting to the central repository and other
	services behind the vestasys.org firewall is essentially
	what's described in <a
	href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/VPN-HOWTO.html">the Linux
	VPN HOWTO</a>: PPP over ssh.  This method was chosen for
	several reasons:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  <i>Linux can be used for both ends of the connection.</i>
	  Linux is fairly ubiquitous.  We don't intend to exclude
	  other platforms, and this method can probably be adapted to
	  others.  If desired, Linux can simply be used for routing
	  and mangling packets.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <i>The neccessary software is often already installed.</i>
	  Most distributions include the ssh client in the default
	  install.  <tt>pppd</tt> is also commonly installed.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <i>It's easier to set up than IPSec.</i> IPSec may be a
	  cleaner solution overall, but the major implementation
	  (<a href="http://www.freeswan.org/">FreeS/WAN</a>) requires building a custom kernel after patching
	  the source.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <i>It's more secure than PPTP.</i>
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	We provide a standard script for initiating a VPN connection
	to <tt>vestasys.org</tt>: <a
	href="vestasys-vpn">vestasys-vpn</a>.  It has <a
	href="vestasys-vpn.html">its own man page</a>.  Anyone wishing
	to connect to <tt>vestasys.org</tt> should send e-mail to
	
	vpn&#45;admin&#64;vestasys&#46;org.
      </p>

    <h2>IP Address Space Allocation</h2>

      <p>
	The <tt>vestasys.org</tt> Intranet uses the class A private range
	address space (10.0.0.0/8).
      </p>

      <p>
	All interfaces on the <tt>vestasys.org</tt> physical network
	use addresses within 10.86.0.0/24.  (86 is ASCII 'V'.)
      </p>

      <p>
	Each contributor needing access to the central repository will
	be allocated an 8-bit (class C size) address range.  Initially
	these allocations will have the same first two bytes
	(10.86.1.0/24, 10.86.2.0/24, ...).
      </p>

      <p>
	Before anyone asks, no, we do not yet have a plan for
	migration to IPv6.
      </p>

    <h2>Network Address Translation</h2>

      <p>
	Because <tt>vestasys.org</tt> uses a private range address
	space (10.0.0.0/8) and we intend to allow contributors to
	connect other networks which may use the same private range
	address space, network address translation is a necessity.
	The NAT duties are distributed such that each endpoint of the
	VPN connection only needs to perform translations for the
	hosts on its local network.
      </p>

      <p>
	Contributor sites should address the <tt>vestasys.org</tt>
	machines by their published IP addresses.  (We assume that
	those addresses will not be co-opted by others on their
	private networks.)  Packets coming to <tt>vestasys.org</tt>
	over a VPN connection get their destinations translated from
	the public addresses to the corresponding private range ones.
	Packets leaving <tt>vestasys.org</tt> via a VPN connection get
	their sources translated from the private addresses to the
	public ones.
      </p>

      <p>
	<tt>vestasys.org</tt> machines will address contributor sites
	by addresses within their assigned address ranges.  (See
	&quot;IP Address Space Allocation&quot; above.)  The
	contributor's VPN endpoint is responsible for handling
	appropriate source and destination NAT rules.  Any
	repositories at the client site will need to be assigned a
	specific IP address.  (See &quot;Repository Name
	Resolution&quot; below.)  Other hosts can be handled with
	many-to-one or many-to-many SNAT.  (<a
	href="http://netfilter.samba.org/netfilter-faq-3.html#ss3.5">See
	the Netfilter/iptables FAQ for a few words on many-to-many
	SNAT</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
	Thus, each end of a VPN connection is only responsible for
	translating the addresses of the machines on the LAN to which
	it is directly connected.  The end at <tt>vestasys.org</tt>
	translates between the private and public range addresses for
	the <tt>vestasys.org</tt> hosts.  The end at a contributor
	site translates between the local addresses of clients and
	addresses in the contributor's assigned IP address range.
      </p>

    <h3>NAT Example</h3>

      <p>
	Suppose there is a contributor site which has a client host
	addressed locally as 192.168.1.10.  This address is translated
	by one-to-one SNAT at the client VPN endpoint to 10.86.1.2.
	Below is a table showing the addresses used during a
	communication between this client and the central repository
	server (<tt>dev.vestasys.org</tt>) on the client network, over
	the VPN ppp link, and on the <tt>vestasys.org</tt> network.
      </p>

      <table border=1>
	<tr>
	<th>Network</th>
	<th>client address</th>
	<th>server address</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<th>Contributor LAN</th>
	<td>192.168.1.10</td>
	<td>63.114.50.11</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<th>VPN ppp link</th>
	<td>10.86.1.2</td>
	<td>63.114.50.11</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<th><tt>vestasys.org</tt> LAN</th>
	<td>10.86.1.2</td>
	<td>10.86.0.2</td>
	</tr>
      </table>

    <h2>Routing</h2>

      <p>
	Contributor sites should route packets to the central
	repository machine (<tt>dev.vestasys.org</tt>) over their VPN
	link.  (Other machines accessible this way may be added in the
	future.)  Contributor sites must <b>not</b> route packets to
	the <tt>vestasys.org</tt> firewall
	(<tt>wall.vestasys.org</tt>) over the VPN connection, as it is
	the endpoint for that connection and must therefore be
	reachable by another route.
      </p>

      <p>
	<tt>vestasys.org</tt> will route any packets for a
	conrtibutor's IP address range over their VPN link (when it's
	active).  (See &quot;IP Address Space Allocation&quot; above.)
      </p>

    <h2>Packet Filtering</h2>

      <p>
	The packet filtering at <tt>vestasys.org</tt> implements these
	policies:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  Any packets coming off of a VPN connection and destined
	  somewhere other than the physical local LAN will be dropped.
	  This prevents one contributor's network from connecting to
	  that of another simultaneously connected contributor.  It
	  also prevents packets from escaping out onto the Internet at
	  large.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Any packets from a VPN connection destined for an IP address
	  other than the central repository server will be dropped.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Certain ICMP types will be allowed.  (Secifically, types 3,
	  0, 8, and 11, which correspond to &quot;destination
	  unreachable&quot;, &quot;echo reply&quot;, &quot;echo
	  request&quot;, and &quot;time exceeded&quot;.)
	</li>

	<li>
          New connection attempts to ports other than 22
          (<tt>ssh</tt>), 23 (<tt>telnet</tt>), and unpriviledged
          ports (>1023) will be dropped.  Once the keep-alive fix is
          implemented in the SRPC library (eliminating
          backwards-pointing pinger connections on arbitrary
          unpriviledged ports), this will be further restricted to
          ports 22, 23, and 21776 (the repository's SRPC port).
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	An individual contributor's VPN endpoint may want to add their
	own packet filtering rules.  The suggested packet filtering
	policies are outlined below:
      </p>

      <ul>

	<li>
	  Any packets coming off the VPN interface destined for hosts
	  other than the set of client hosts allowed to use VPN
	  connection should be dropped.  (Such hosts can usually be
	  recognized by matching against an IP address range, such as
	  192.168.1.0/24.)  Similarly, any packets heading for the VPN
	  interface coming from hosts other than the authorized set of
	  clients should be dropped.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Packets coming from the VPN interface with a source address
	  other than that of the central repository
	  (<tt>dev.vestasys.org</tt>) may be droppped.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Certain ICMP types should be allowed going to and coming
	  from the VPN interface.  (Definitely type 3, which is
	  &quot;destination unreachable&quot;, and probably also types
	  0, 8, and 11, which are to &quot;echo reply&quot;,
	  &quot;echo request&quot;, and &quot;time exceeded&quot;.)
	</li>

	<li>
	  Packets in already established connections should be
	  allowed.
	</li>

	<li>
	  New connections from the VPN interface to the local
	  repository machine on unpriviledged ports should be allowed.
	  (Once the keep-alive fix is implemented in the SRPC library
	  this can be restrictied to just the repository's SRPC port,
	  which is usually port 21776.)  This is neccessary to allow
	  remote checkout/checkin of source code from/to the central
	  repoisitory, as well as mastership transfer and replication.
	</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
	We also provide <a href="contributor-filter.sh">an example
	script for setting up contributor-site filtering rules similar
	to those outlined above</a>.
      </p>

    <h2>Repository Name Resolution</h2>

      <p>
	Vesta repositories are referred to by their hostnames.
	Because of this, any tool which needs to contact a repository
	(including other repositories for purposes of replication,
	remote checkout, and mastership transfer) must be able to
	resolve its name.
      </p>

      <p>
	For our purposes this is not straightforward, because the
	hostnames of machines running participating repositories are
	often unpublished (because they are themselves on private
	networks behind firewalls).  It's further complicated by the
	fact that the addresses by which the central repository should
	contact such repositories are not the same as their addresses
	they are known by on their own local networks.  (See
	&quot;Network Address Translation&quot; above.)
      </p>

      <p>
	Our current solution is simply to add entries to the
	<tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file on the central repository machine for
	each contributing site's repository (possibly obscuring it's
	normal IP).  This is a bit of a kludge, but it works.
      </p>

      <p>
	As an example, suppose there is a participating site at
	<tt>foo.com</tt>.  The Vesta repository at <tt>foo.com</tt> is
	<tt>bar.foo.com</tt>.  Their assigned address range is
	10.86.13.0/24.  Their repository has its address translated to
	10.86.13.7 on the <tt>vestasys.org</tt> network.  To
	facilitate their participation, the central repository is
	given a host table entry saying that <tt>bar.foo.com</tt> has
	the address 10.86.13.7.  Then, when the central repository
	needs to contact the repository at <tt>bar.foo.com</tt> (for
	example, when replicating in a newly checked-in version of one
	of the core Vesta packages), it gets the correct IP address.
      </p>

    <h2>Repository Exports and Realm Names</h2>

      <p>
	Assigning each contributing site its own IP address range
	simplifies the matter of writing the repository exports.  Each
	site needs just one line in the central repository's exports
	file allowing all hosts in its network range to connect using
	its chosen realm name.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, if <tt>foo.com</tt> is assigned 10.86.13.0/24,
	their line in the repository export file on
	<tt>dev.vestasys.org</tt> would be:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<tt>10.86.13.0/24: allow global foo.com</tt>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	See <a
	href="../doc/man/html/repository.8.html#AccessControl">the
	&quot;Access Control&quot; section of the repository(8) man
	page</a> for information on realm names and the format of the
	repository's export file.
