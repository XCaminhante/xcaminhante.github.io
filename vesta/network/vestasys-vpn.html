<P></P></DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="system requirements">SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</A></H1>
<P>At this time, this script has only been tested on Linux systems (both
IA-32 and Alpha) running 2.4 kernels.  pppd (2.4 and up), the ssh
client (OpenSSH 2.5.2p2 or newer), and the iptables tools must be
installed.  The kernel must have support for ppp and iptables,
including NAT.  RedHat 7.1 meets these requirements out of the box.
The Debian ``testing'' distribution with a 2.4 kernel added can meet
them.</P>
<P>Lastly, since this script uses native iptables rules, it is
incompatible with the backwards-compatibility ipchains support in the
2.4 kernel.  RedHat 7.1 uses this by default, and it must be disabled
(usually by disabling the /etc/init.d/ipchains script with ``chkconfig
--level 0123456 ipchains off'').  You can check whether your system is
using the ipchains compatibility code with ``lsmod | grep ipchains''.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="getting set up">GETTING SET UP</A></H1>
<P>Before running the setup process, be sure to contact the administrator
of the remote server and get some key pieces of information.  The
setup dialog will ask you for both of these:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_VPN_username"><STRONG>VPN username</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
An account on the remote machine will be created for you that is used
exclusively for making a VPN connection.  (In fact, it will be set
with pppd as its shell, so it cannot be used for anything else.)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_IP_address_range"><STRONG>IP address range</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
You will be given a range of IP addresses which you can use for the
translated addresses of your local machines (see ``Network Address
Translation'' below).
<P></P></DL>
<P>Also, you must know enough about your local network setup to be able
to decide which hosts will need specific IP associations for NAT.
Specifically, if you have any local servers that need to be accessible
from the remote network (such as a local Vesta repository), you must
assign those hosts specific translated addresses.  (See ``Network
Address Translation'' below.)</P>
<P>After running the setup process, you must send your ssh authentication
key to the VPN administrator so that your connection can be
authenticated.  (Until you do this, you will be unable to connect.)</P>
<P>This script is designed to be usable in the rc/init framework.  On a
RedHat system, you can simply place it in /etc/rc.d/init.d and execute
``chkconfig --add vestasys-vpn'' to add the necessary symlinks in the
runlevel sub-directories.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="network address translation">NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION</A></H1>
<P>IP addresses on the local network are not necessarily usable on the
remote network.  Therefore, outgoing connections and selected incoming
connections will have their addresses translated.</P>
<P>Any hosts on the local network which will provide specific services to
the remote one (such as a local Vesta repository or other server)
should be assigned a specific IP addresses out of your assigned IP
address range.  These will get both source and destination NAT rules.</P>
<P>Unassigned addresses in your range will be used for a catch-all
multiple-target SNAT rule.  This will cause outgoing connections over
the VPN link to have their source address translated to an IP selected
from the otherwise unused ones.</P>
<P>[The next paragraph gives some details on the NAT rules added by this
script.  Most people can skip it.]</P>
<P>The address translation rules are placed in user-defined chains in the
``nat'' table named &lt;server&gt;-pre and &lt;server&gt;-post
(e.g. wall.vestasys.org-pre and wall.vestasys.org-post).  The source
NAT rules are placed in the &lt;server&gt;-post chain, and all
connections going out over the VPN link are sent to it from the
POSTROUTING chain.  The destination NAT rules for local hosts assigned
specific translated addresses are placed in the &lt;server&gt;-pre
chain, and all connections coming in from the VPN link are sent to it
from the PREROUTING chain.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="routing and forwarding">ROUTING AND FORWARDING</A></H1>
<P>Since the point of this script is to create a connection between two
networks, it allows the user to specify a list of hosts and networks
to be routed over the VPN connection.  Once the link becomes active
and the NAT packet mangling rules have been added, the routes are set
up.</P>
<P>Also, this script assumes that the machine running it will act as a
gateway for other machines.  For that reason, packet forwarding is
enabled once the link is active.</P>
<P>In order to make this useful for other machines, the user must modify
other routing tables to direct packets to the machine making the VPN
connection that should be forwarded over it.  This script provides no
help with that.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="packet filtering">PACKET FILTERING</A></H1>
<P>At this time, this script does not add any rules to filter packets
going to or coming from the VPN connection.  However, the user is free
to add such rules.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="configuration">CONFIGURATION</A></H1>
<P>Almost all of the information gathered and created during the <STRONG>setup</STRONG>
step is stored in a central configuration file.  This is usually in
/etc/vestasys-org-vpn.conf.  The location of the configuration file
may be overridden by setting the environment variable
VESTASYS_ORG_VPN_CONFIG before running this script.</P>
<P>The config file can contain:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
blank lines,
<P></P>
<LI>
comments starting with # and extending to the end of the line,
<P></P>
<LI>
simple variable settings of the form ``&lt;<EM>variable</EM>&gt; =
&lt;<EM>value</EM>&gt;'',
<P></P>
<LI>
route specifications of the form ``route &lt;<EM>host or net</EM>&gt;'',
<P></P>
<LI>
NAT associations of the form ``nat &lt;<EM>local address</EM>&gt;
&lt;<EM>remote address</EM>&gt;'',
<P></P></UL>
<P>In general, if you need to change something in the configuration, you
can just rerun the <STRONG>setup</STRONG> step.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="environment">ENVIRONMENT</A></H1>
<P>The only environment variable used by this script is
VESTASYS_ORG_VPN_CONFIG which can be used to point to an alternate
config file location.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="files">FILES</A></H1>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Fetc%2Fvestasys%2Dorg%2Dvpn%2Econf">/etc/vestasys-org-vpn.conf</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The configuration file used by default.  Can be overridden by setting
the VESTASYS_ORG_VPN_CONFIG environment variable.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Fetc%2Fppp%2Fpeers%2F%3Cserver_name%3E">/etc/ppp/peers/&lt;<EM>server name</EM>&gt;</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The ppp peer file written by the <STRONG>setup</STRONG> step.  This contains
directives telling pppd important things including ``use ssh to
connect'' and ``don't add a default route''.
<P>A different directory from /etc/ppp can be set in the <STRONG>setup</STRONG> step,
but it must be the parent of the peers directory that your pppd uses.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24HOME%2F%2Essh%2Fknown_hosts2"><STRONG>$HOME</STRONG>/.ssh/known_hosts2</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The list of remote host authentication keys for the user running the
script (which should be root).  This script will check for the correct
host key for the remote server and add it if it is not already
present.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24HOME%2F%2Essh%2Fid_dsa%2E%3Cserver_name%3E"><STRONG>$HOME</STRONG>/.ssh/id_dsa.&lt;<EM>server name</EM>&gt;</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The key used to authenticate your connection to the remote network.
This is usually generated during the <STRONG>setup</STRONG> procedure.  This is the
default location, but a different one can be set during <STRONG>setup</STRONG>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fppp%2D%3Cserver_name%3E%2Epid">/var/run/ppp-&lt;<EM>server name</EM>&gt;.pid</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
An information file written by pppd.  We ask for it specifically with
the ``linkname'' pppd option in the peer file.  It contains both the
process ID of the running pppd and the interface name (e.g. ppp0).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Fproc%2Fsys%2Fnet%2Fipv4%2Fip_forward">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The pseudo-file that controls IP forwarding on Linux systems.  Used to
enable IP forwarding after initiating the connection.
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="limitations">LIMITATIONS</A></H1>
<P>If you have a global ppp options file (usually /etc/ppp/options), it
may contain options which will interfere with this script.  This
script is not smart enough to examine the contents of such a file to
determine if the options there will cause problems for the VPN
connection.  However, it will warn you during the <STRONG>setup</STRONG> step if you
have a non-empty global options file.</P>
<P>If the machine running this script has other NAT rules in its
PREROUTING and POSTROUTING chains, the rules this script adds may not
function properly.  (However, we believe that the rules added by this
script will not interfere with existing NAT rules.)  You can check for
existing rules before starting a connection with this script with the
command ``iptables --list --table nat --numeric''.</P>
<P>This script does not currently add any rules to filter packets coming
from or going to the VPN link.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H1>
<P>The <STRONG>setup</STRONG> procedure could probably be a bit less chatty and just
assume that if it finds things like pppd and ssh in the standard
places that it can use them without asking the user for confirmation
of this.</P>
